	Abstract = {Whether BP Piscium (BP Psc) is either a pre-main sequence T Tauri star at d ~ 80 pc, or a post-main sequence G giant at d ~ 300 pc is still not clear. As a first-ascent giant, it is the first to be observed with a molecular and dust disk. Alternatively, BP Psc would be among the nearest T Tauri stars with a protoplanetary disk (PPD). We investigate whether the disk geometry resembles typical PPDs, by comparing polarimetric images with radiative transfer models. Our VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations allow us to perform Polarimetric Differential Imaging; Reference Star Differential Imaging; and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution. We present the first visible light polarization and intensity images of the disk of BP Psc. Our deconvolution confirms the disk shape as detected before, mainly showing the southern side of the disk. In polarized intensity the disk is imaged at larger detail and also shows the northern side, giving it the typical shape of high inclination flared disks. We explain the observed disk features by retrieving the large-scale geometry with MCMax radiative transfer modeling, which yields a strongly flared model, atypical for disks of T Tauri stars.},

@article{kaw16a,
	Abstract = {On 2011 September 6, we observed an X2.1-class flare in continuum and H$\alpha$ with a frame rate of about 30~Hz. After processing images of the event by using a speckle-masking image reconstruction, we identified white-light (WL) flare ribbons on opposite sides of the magnetic neutral line. We derive the lightcurve decay times of the WL flare kernels at each resolution element by assuming that the kernels consist of one or two components that decay exponentially, starting from the peak time. As a result, 42% of the pixels have two decay-time components with average decay times of 15.6 and 587 s, whereas the average decay time is 254 s for WL kernels with only one decay-time component. The peak intensities of the shorter decay-time component exhibit good spatial correlation with the WL intensity, whereas the peak intensities of the long decay-time components tend to be larger in the early phase of the flare at the inner part of the flare ribbons, close to the magnetic neutral line. The average intensity of the longer decay-time components is 1.78 times higher than that of the shorter decay-time components. If the shorter decay time is determined by either the chromospheric cooling time or the nonthermal ionization timescale and the longer decay time is attributed to the coronal cooling time, this result suggests that WL sources from both regions appear in 42% of the WL kernels and that WL emission of the coronal origin is sometimes stronger than that of chromospheric origin.},

@article{war16a,
	Abstract = {Stars of stellar type later than about M3.5 are believed to be fully convective and therefore unable to support magnetic dynamos like the one that produces the 11-year solar cycle. Because of their intrinsic faintness, very few late M stars have undergone long-term monitoring to test this prediction, which is critical to our understanding of magnetic field generation in such stars. Magnetic activity is also of interest as the driver of UV and X-ray radiation, as well as energetic particles and stellar winds, that affect the atmospheres of close-in planets that lie within habitable zones, such as the recently discovered Proxima b. We report here on several years of optical, UV, and X-ray observations of Proxima Centauri (GJ 551; dM5.5e): 15 years of ASAS photometry in the V band (1085 nights) and 3 years in the I band (196 nights), 4 years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations (more than 120 exposures), and 9 sets of X-ray observations from other X-ray missions (ASCA, XMM-Newton, and three Chandra instruments) spanning 22 years. We confirm previous reports of an 83-day rotational period and find strong evidence for a 7-year stellar cycle, along with indications of differential rotation at about the solar level. X-ray/UV intensity is anti-correlated with optical V-band brightness for both rotational and cyclical variations. From comparison with other stars observed to have X-ray cycles we deduce a simple empirical relationship between X-ray cyclic modulation and Rossby number, and we also present Swift UV grism spectra covering 2300-6000 {\AA}.},

@article{dra16a,
	Abstract = {LkCa 15 is an extensively studied star in the Taurus region known for its pre-transitional disk with a large inner cavity in dust continuum and normal gas accretion rate. The most popular hypothesis to explain the LkCa 15 data invokes one or more planets to carve out the inner cavity, while gas continues to flow across the gap from the outer disk onto the central star. We present spatially unresolved HCO+ J=4-3 observations of the LkCa 15 disk from the JCMT and model the data with the ProDiMo code. We find that: (1) HCO+ line-wings are clearly detected, certifying the presence of gas in the cavity within <50 AU of the star. (2) Reproducing the observed line-wing flux requires both a significant suppression of cavity dust (by a factor >10^4 compared to the ISM) and a substantial increase in the gas scale-height within the cavity (H_0/R_0 ~ 0.6). An ISM dust-to-gas ratio (d:g=10^-2) yields too little line-wing flux regardless of the scale-height or cavity gas geometry, while a smaller scale-height also under predicts the flux even with a reduced d:g. (3) The cavity gas mass is consistent with the surface density profile of the outer disk extended inwards to the sublimation radius (corresponding to mass M_d ~ 0.03 M_sun), and masses lower by a factor >10 appear to be ruled out.},

	Abstract = {This paper continues our study of the foreground population to the Orion molecular clouds. The goal is to characterize the foreground population north of NGC 1981 and to investigate the star formation history in the large Orion star-forming region. We focus on a region covering about 25 square degrees, centered on the $\epsilon$ Orionis supergiant (HD 37128, B0\,Ia) and covering the Orion Belt asterism. We used a combination of optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (2MASS) data, informed by X-ray (\textit{XMM-Newton}) and mid-infrared (WISE) data, to construct a suite of color-color and color-magnitude diagrams for all available sources. We then applied a new statistical multiband technique to isolate a previously unknown stellar population in this region. We identify a rich and well-defined stellar population in the surveyed region that has about 2\,000 objects that are mostly M stars. We infer the age for this new population to be at least 5\, Myr and likely $\sim10$\,Myr and estimate a total of about 2\,500 members, assuming a normal IMF. This new population, which we call the Orion Belt population, is essentially extinction-free, disk-free, and its spatial distribution is roughly centered near $\epsilon$ Ori, although substructure is clearly present. The Orion Belt population is likely the low-mass counterpart to the Ori OB Ib subgroup. Although our results do not rule out Blaauw's sequential star formation scenario for Orion, we argue that the recently proposed blue streams scenario provides a better framework on which one can explain the Orion star formation region as a whole. We speculate that the Orion Belt population could represent the evolved counterpart of an Orion nebula-like cluster.},

	Abstract = {Type III bursts and hard X-rays are both produced by flare energetic electron beams. The link between both emissions has been investigated in many previous studies, but no statistical studies have compared both coronal and interplanetary type III bursts with X-ray flares. Using coronal radio events above 100 MHz exclusively from type III bursts, we revisited long-standing questions: Do all coronal type III bursts have X-ray counterparts. What correlation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities. What X-ray and radio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary type III bursts below 14 MHz. We analysed data from 2002 to 2011 starting with coronal type III bursts above 100 MHz. We used RHESSI X-ray data greater than 6 keV to make a list of 321 events that have associated type III bursts and X-ray flares, encompassing at least 28 percent of the initial sample of type III events. We examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and any interplanetary radio signature. For our 321 events, the X-ray emission at 6 keV usually lasted longer than type III burst groups at frequencies greater than 100 MHz. A weak correlation was found between the type III radio flux at frequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25-50 keV, with an absence of events at high X-ray intensity and low type III radio flux. Interplanetary type III bursts less than 14 MHz were observed for 54 percent of the events, increasing when events were observed with 25-50 keV X-rays. A stronger interplanetary association was present when 25-50 keV count rates were above 250 counts per second or 170 MHz fluxes were greater than 1000 SFU, relating to more energetic electrons above 25 keV and events where magnetic flux tubes extend into the high corona. On average type III bursts increase in flux with decreasing frequency, the rate varies from event to event.},

	Abstract = {23 giant flares from 13 active stars (eight RS CVn systems, one Algol system, three dMe stars and one YSO) were detected during the first two years of our all-sky X-ray monitoring with the gas propotional counters (GSC) of the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). The observed parameters of all of these MAXI/GSC flares are found to be at the upper ends for stellar flares with the luminosity of 10^(31-34) ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band, the emission measure of 10^(54-57) cm-3, the e-folding time of 1 hour to 1.5 days, and the total radiative energy released during the flare of 10^(34-39) ergs. Notably, the peak X-ray luminosity of 5(3-9)*10^33 ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band was detected in one of the flares on II Peg, which is one of the, or potentially the, largest ever observed in stellar flares. X-ray flares were detected from GT Mus, V841 Cen, SZ Psc, and TWA-7 for the first time in this survey. Whereas most of our detected sources are multiple-star systems, two of them are single stars (YZ CMi and TWA-7). Among the stellar sources within 100 pc distance, the MAXI/GSC sources have larger rotation velocities than the other sources. This suggests that the rapid rotation velocity may play a key role in generating large flares. Combining the X-ray flare data of nearby stars and the sun, taken from literature and our own data, we discovered a universal correlation of tau~L_X^0.2 for the flare duration tau and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity L_X in the 0.1-100 keV band, which holds for 5 and 12 orders of magnitude in tau and L_X, respectively. The MAXI/GSC sample is located at the highest ends on the correlation.},

	Abstract = {There is growing theoretical and observational evidence that protoplanetary disc evolution may be significantly affected by the canonical levels of far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation found in a star forming environment, leading to substantial stripping of material from the disc outer edge even in the absence of nearby massive stars. In this paper we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon dominated region (PDR) which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass loss rate and location of their "critical radius". This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi--analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

@article{cos16a,
	Abstract = {Context. It is generally accepted that, in Classical T Tauri Stars, the plasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free fall velocity, and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected to contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have confirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise, there are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed UV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. Aims. We investigated the effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock plasma at the base of the accretion stream with the aim to identify in which region a significant part of the UV emission originates. Methods. We developed a 1D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the stellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating due to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of the infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the post-shock region. Results. We found that the radiative heating of the pre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In particular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is gradually heated up to few $10^5$\;K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from the shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect significantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a region of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the unshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our model naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to accretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.},

	Abstract = {EPIC 204278916 has been serendipitously discovered from its K2 light curve which displays irregular dimmings of up to 65% for ~25 consecutive days out of 78.8 days of observations. For the remaining duration of the observations, the variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The star is a young, low-mass (M-type) pre-main-sequence star with clear evidence of a resolved tilted disk from ALMA observations. We examine the K2 light curve in detail and hypothesise that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits. The explanations discussed here are particularly relevant for other recently discovered young objects with similar absorption dips.},

	Abstract = {We present self-consistent calculations coupling numerical hydrodynamics simulations of collapsing pre-stellar cores and stellar evolution models of accreting objects. We analyse the main impact of consistent accretion history on the evolution and lithium depletion of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. These consistent models confirm the generation of a luminosity spread in Herzsprung-Russell diagrams at ages $\sim$ 1-10 Myr. They also confirm that early accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a previous study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results strengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young clusters should be extremely rare. We also find that early phases of burst accretion can produce coeval models of similar mass with a range of different Li surface abundances, and in particular with Li-excess compared to the predictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle competition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central stellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion of fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a subtle combination of effects. This new result could explain the recent, puzzling observations of Li-excess of fast rotators in the young cluster NGC 2264. Present self-consistent accreting models are available in electronic form.},

	Abstract = {The timescale of cluster formation is an essential parameter in order to understand the formation process of star clusters. Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in nearby young open clusters reveal a large spread in brightness. If the spread were considered as a result of a real spread in age, the corresponding cluster formation timescale would be about 5 -- 20 Myr. Hence it could be interpreted that star formation in an open cluster is prolonged for up to a few tens of Myr. However, difficulties in reddening correction, observational errors, and systematic uncertainties introduced by imperfect evolutionary models for PMS stars, can result in an artificial age spread. Alternatively, we can utilize Li abundance as a relative age indicator of PMS star to determine the cluster formation timescale. The optical spectra of 134 PMS stars in NGC 2264 have been obtained with MMT/Hectochelle. The equivalent widths have been measured for 86 PMS stars with a detectable Li line (3500 < T_eff [K] <= 6500). Li abundance under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was derived using the conventional curve of growth method. After correction for non-LTE effects, we find that the initial Li abundance of NGC 2264 is A(Li) = 3.2 +/- 0.2. From the distribution of the Li abundances, the underlying age spread of the visible PMS stars is estimated to be about 3 -- 4 Myr and this, together with the presence of embedded populations in NGC 2264, suggests that the cluster formed on a timescale shorter than 5 Myr.},

	Abstract = {Crucial information on the mass accretion-ejection in young stars can be obtained from high spatial resolution images of jets in sources with recurrent accretion outbursts. Using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument, we observed the young binary Z CMa that is composed of a Herbig Be star and a FUor object, both driving a jet. We analyse the structure of the two jets in relation with previous accretion events observed in this target. We obtained optical images in the Halpha and OI 6300A lines at the unprecedented angular resolution of ~0.03 arcsec, on which we have performed both continuum subtraction and deconvolution, thereby deriving results that are consistent with each other. Our images reveal extended emission from both sources: a fairly compact and poorly collimated emission SW of the Herbig component and an extended collimated and precessing jet from the FUor component. The compact emission from the Herbig star is compatible with a wide-angle wind and is possibly connected to the recent outburst events shown by this component. The FUor jet is traced down to 70 mas (80 AU) from the source and is highly collimated with a width of 26-48 AU at distances 100-200 AU, which is similar to the width of jets from T Tauri stars. This strongly suggests that the same magneto-centrifugal jet-launching mechanism also operates in FUors. The observed jet wiggle can be modelled as originating from an orbital motion with a period of 4.2 yr around an unseen companion with mass between 0.48 and 1 Msun. The jet mass loss rate Mloss was derived from the OI luminosity and is in the range 1E-8 and 1E-6 Msun/yr. This is the first direct Mloss measurement from a jet in a FUor. If we assume previous Macc estimates obtained through modelling of the accretion disk, the derived range of Mloss would imply a very low mass-ejection efficiency (Mloss/Macc < 0.02), which is lower than that typical of T Tauri stars.},

@article{kuz16a,
	Abstract = {We present systematic analysis of spatio-temporal evolution of sources of hard X-ray (HXR) pulsations in solar flares. We concentrate on disk flares whose impulsive phase are accompanied by a series of more than three peaks (pulsations) of HXR emission detected in the RHESSI 50-100 keV channel with 4-second cadence. 29 such flares observed from February 2002 to June 2015 with time differences between successive peaks of 8-270 s are studied. The main observational result is that sources of HXR pulsations in all flares are not stationary, they demonstrate apparent displacements from pulsation to pulsation. The flares can be subdivided into two groups depending on character of dynamics of HXR sources. The group-1 consists of 16 flares (55%) with systematic dynamics of HXR sources from pulsation to pulsation with respect to a magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL), which has simple extended trace on the photosphere. The group-2 consists of 13 flares (45%) with more chaotic displacements of HXR sources with respect to an MPIL having more complicated structure. Based on the observations we conclude that the mechanism of flare HXR pulsations is related to successive triggering of energy release in different magnetic loops. Group-1 flare regions consist of loops stacked into magnetic arcades extended along MPILs. Group-2 flare regions have more complicated magnetic structures and loops are arranged more chaotically. We also found that at least 14 (88%) group-1 flares and 11 (85%) group-2 flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, i.e. the majority of flares studied are eruptive events. This gives an indication that eruptive processes play important role in generation of HXR pulsations. We suggest that an erupting flux rope can act as a trigger of energy release. Its successive interaction with different loops can lead to apparent motion of HXR sources and to a series of HXR pulsations.},

	Abstract = {The bulk of X-ray emission from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars is coronal in origin. We demonstrate herein that stars on Henyey tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram have lower $\log(L_X/L_\ast)$, on average, than stars on Hayashi tracks. This effect is driven by the decay of $L_X$ once stars develop radiative cores. $L_X$ decays faster with age for intermediate mass PMS stars, the progenitors of main sequence A-type stars, compared to those of lower mass. As almost all main sequence A-type stars show no detectable X-ray emission, we may already be observing the loss of their coronae during their PMS evolution. Although there is no direct link between the size or mass of the radiative core and $L_X$, the longer stars have spent with partially convective interiors, the weaker their X-ray emission becomes.

	Abstract = {We analyzed the occurrence rates of flares on stars of spectral types K, G, F, and A, observed by Kepler. We found that the histogram of occurrence frequencies of stellar flares is systematically shifted towards a high-energy tail for A-type stars compared to stars of cooler spectral types. We extrapolated the fitted power laws towards flares with smaller energies (nanoflares) and made estimates for total energy flux to stellar atmospheres by flares. We found that for A-type stars the total energy flux density was at least 4-times smaller than for G-stars. We speculate that this deficit in energy supply may explain the lack of hot coronae on A-type stars. Our results indicate an importance of nanoflares for heating and formation of the solar corona.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the dust structure of gravitationally unstable gas disks undergoing mass accretion from the envelope, envisioning application to Class 0/I YSOs. We compute evolution of the surface density and dust size by taking into account dust collisional growth and radial drift. We find that the dust disk quickly settles into the steady state and the dust mass in the steady-state disk decreases by a factor of 1/2 to 1/3, while the radiative flux of the dust thermal emission also decreases by a factor of 1/3 to 1/5, both compared to that for a disk with ISM dust-to-gas mass ratio and micron-sized dust. We suggest that the disk mass in the Class 0/I YSOs is underestimated by factor of 1/3 to 1/5 when it is calculated from the dust thermal emission assuming an ISM dust-to-gas mass ratio and micron-sized dust opacity, and that a larger fraction of the disks in Class 0/I YSOs is gravitationally unstable than previously considered. We derive an empirical formula for the disk-mass reduction rate, which can be used to test whether or not the disks observed in Class 0/I YSOs are gravitationally unstable. We also investigate the orbital radius of planetesimal formation $r_{\rm P}$ and show that $r_{\rm P}$ becomes $\sim 20$ AU. Because $r_{\rm P}$ increases as the gas surface density increases and a gravitationally unstable disk has a theoretical maximum gas surface density, $r_{\rm P}\sim 20$ AU is the theoretical maximum radius for planetesimal formation. We find that the dust particles migrate inwardly in the form of "pebble", and we suggest that planet formation via pebble accretion in Class 0/I phase is preferable to that in the Class II phase because the dust is supplied by envelope accretion and a significant amount of dust particles ($M_{\rm dust}\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$) pass through the disk during the Class 0/I phase.},

	Abstract = {Stepwise changes of the photospheric magnetic field, which often becomes more horizontal, have been observed during many flares. Previous interpretations include coronal loops that contract and it has been speculated that such jerks could be responsible for sunquakes. Here we report the detection of stepwise chromospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B$_{\rm LOS}$) changes obtained through spectropolarimetry of Ca II 8542 \AA\ with DST/IBIS during the X1-flare SOL20140329T17:48. They are stronger ($<$640 Mx cm$^{-2}$) and appear in larger areas than their photospheric counterparts ($<$320 Mx cm$^{-2}$). The absolute value of B$_{\rm LOS}$ more often decreases than increases. Photospheric changes are predominantly located near a polarity inversion line, chromospheric changes near footpoints of loops. The locations of changes are near, but not exactly co-spatial to hard X-ray (HXR) emission and neither to enhanced continuum emission, nor a small sunquake. Enhanced chromospheric and coronal emission is observed in nearly all locations that exhibit changes of B$_{\rm LOS}$, but the emission also occurs in many locations without any B$_{\rm LOS}$ changes. Photospheric and chromospheric changes of B$_{\rm LOS}$ show differences in timing, sign, and size and seem independent of each other. A simple model of contracting loops yields changes of opposite sign to those observed. An explanation for this discrepancy could be increasing loop sizes or loops that untwist in a certain direction during the flare. It is yet unclear which processes are responsible for the observed changes, their timing, size and locations, especially considering the incoherence between photosphere and chromosphere.},

@article{lou16a,
	Abstract = {Differences in Doppler shifts across the base of four close classical T-Tauri star jets have been detected with the HST in optical and NUV emission lines, and interpreted as rotation signatures under the assumption of steady state flow. To support this interpretation, it is necessary that the underlying disks rotate in the same sense. Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation determined from optical lines has been verified in two cases and rejected in one. We propose here to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We present ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) observations of the circumstellar disk around the T-Tauri star Th 28. The sub-arcsecond angular resolution (0.46"x0.37") and high-sensitivity reached enable us to detect in CO and continuum clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian rotation around Th28. The 12CO emission allows us to derive estimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation of the peaks in 12CO combined with the resolved extent of the emission indicate a central stellar mass in the range 1-2Msun. The rotation sense of the disk is well detected, in both 13CO and 12CO emission lines, and goes in the opposite sense to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured in the optical lines of the jet. The Th 28 system is now the second system, among the four investigated so far, where counter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These findings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with HST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady assumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies which rely solely on optical lines are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet.},

	Abstract = {NGC6231 is a massive young star cluster, near the center of the Sco OB1 association. While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has received little attention. We present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I X-ray data, where we detect 1613 point X-ray sources. Our main aim is to clarify global properties of NGC6231 down to low masses through a detailed membership assessment, and to study the cluster stars' spatial distribution, the origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and initial mass function. We use X-ray data, complemented by optical/IR data, to establish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar subgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership, as does the distribution of X-ray hardness. We perform spectral modeling of group-stacked X-ray source spectra. We find a large cluster population down to ~0.3 Msun (complete to ~1 Msun), with minimal non-member contamination, with a definite age spread (1-8 Myrs) for the low-mass PMS stars. We argue that low-mass cluster stars also constitute the majority of the few hundreds unidentified X-ray sources. We find mass segregation for the most massive stars. The fraction of circumstellar-disk bearing members is found to be ~5%. Photoevaporation of disks under the action of massive stars is suggested by the spatial distribution of the IR-excess stars. We also find strong Halpha emission in 9% of cluster PMS stars. The dependence of X-ray properties on mass, stellar structure, and age agrees with extrapolations based on other young clusters. The cluster initial mass function, computed over ~2 dex in mass, has a slope Gamma~-1.14. The total mass of cluster members above 1 Msun is 2280 Msun, and the inferred total mass is 4380 Msun. We also study the peculiar, hard X-ray spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star WR79.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of rotation (vsini) and chromospheric activity (Halpha equivalent width) based on an extensive set of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the MIKE instrument on the 6.5 m Magellan Clay telescope. Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in four young stellar associations, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. By comparing Halpha EWs in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, and thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at ~5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13+7-6 and 9+8-2 Myr for the eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates. Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al. (1998) are in agreement with the observed radii to within +/-15%.},

The accretion process in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) can be studied through the analysis of some UV and X-ray emission lines which trace hot gas flows and act as diagnostics of the post-shock downfalling plasma. In the UV band, where higher spectral resolution is available, these lines are characterized by rather complex profiles whose origin is still not clear. Aims. We investigate the origin of UV and X-ray emission at impact regions of density structured (fragmented) accretion streams.We study if and how the stream fragmentation and the resulting structure of the post-shock region determine the observed profiles of UV and X-ray emission lines. Methods. We model the impact of an accretion stream consisting of a series of dense blobs onto the chromosphere of a CTTS through 2D MHD simulations. We explore different levels of stream fragmentation and accretion rates. From the model results, we synthesize C IV (1550 {\AA}) and OVIII (18.97 {\AA}) line profiles. Results. The impacts of accreting blobs onto the stellar chromosphere produce reverse shocks propagating through the blobs and shocked upflows. These upflows, in turn, hit and shock the subsequent downfalling fragments. As a result, several plasma components di?ering for the downfalling velocity, density, and temperature are present altoghether. The profiles of C IV doublet are characterized by two main components: one narrow and redshifted to speed $\approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ and the other broader and consisting of subcomponents with redshift to speed in the range 200 $\approx$ 400 km s$^{-1}$. The profiles of OVIII lines appear more symmetric than C IV and are redshifted to speed $\approx$ 150 km s$^{-1}$. Conclusions. Our model predicts profiles of C IV line remarkably similar to those observed and explains their origin in a natural way as due to stream fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {We present new Herschel PACS observations of 32 T Tauri stars in the young ($\sim$3 Myr) $\sigma$ Ori cluster. Most of our objects are K & M stars with large excesses at 24 $\mu$m. We used irradiated accretion disk models of D'Alessio et al. (2006) to compare their spectral energy distributions with our observational data. We arrive at the following six conclusions. (i) The observed disks are consistent with irradiated accretion disks systems. (ii) Most of our objects (60%) can be explained by significant dust depletion from the upper disk layers. (iii) Similarly, 61% of our objects can be modeled with large disk sizes ($\rm R_{\rm d} \geq$ 100 AU). (iv) The masses of our disks range between 0.03 to 39 $\rm M_{Jup}$, where 35% of our objects have disk masses lower than 1 Jupiter. Although these are lower limits, high mass ($>$ 0.05 M$_{\odot}$) disks, which are present e.g, in Taurus, are missing. (v) By assuming a uniform distribution of objects around the brightest stars at the center of the cluster, we found that 80% of our disks are exposed to external FUV radiation of $300 \leq G_{0} \leq 1000$, which can be strong enough to photoevaporate the outer edges of the closer disks. (vi) Within 0.6 pc from $\sigma$ Ori we found forbidden emission lines of [NII] in the spectrum of one of our large disk (SO662), but no emission in any of our small ones. This suggests that this object may be an example of a photoevaporating disk.},

	Abstract = {We present a large data set of high-cadence dMe flare light curves obtained with custom continuum filters on the triple-beam, high-speed camera system ULTRACAM. The measurements provide constraints for models of the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and optical continuum spectral evolution on timescales of ≈1 s. We provide a robust interpretation of the flare emission in the ULTRACAM filters using simultaneously obtained low-resolution spectra during two moderate-sized flares in the dM4.5e star YZ CMi. By avoiding the spectral complexity within the broadband Johnson filters, the ULTRACAM filters are shown to characterize bona fide continuum emission in the NUV, blue, and red wavelength regimes. The NUV/blue flux ratio in flares is equivalent to a Balmer jump ratio, and the blue/red flux ratio provides an estimate for the color temperature of the optical continuum emission. We present a new ``color-color'' relationship for these continuum flux ratios at the peaks of the flares. Using the RADYN and RH codes, we interpret the ULTRACAM filter emission using the dominant emission processes from a radiative-hydrodynamic flare model with a high nonthermal electron beam flux, which explains a hot, T ≈ 104 K, color temperature at blue-to-red optical wavelengths and a small Balmer jump ratio as observed in moderate-sized and large flares alike. We also discuss the high time resolution, high signal-to-noise continuum color variations observed in YZ CMi during a giant flare, which increased the NUV flux from this star by over a factor of 100.

	Abstract = {We present a unified computational framework that can be used to describe impulsive flares on the Sun and on dMe stars. The models assume that the flare impulsive phase is caused by a beam of charged particles that is accelerated in the corona and propagates downward depositing energy and momentum along the way. This rapidly heats the lower stellar atmosphere causing it to explosively expand and dramatically brighten. Our models consist of flux tubes that extend from the sub-photosphere into the corona. We simulate how flare-accelerated charged particles propagate down one-dimensional flux tubes and heat the stellar atmosphere using the Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. Detailed radiative transfer is included so that model predictions can be directly compared with observations. The flux of flare-accelerated particles drives return currents which additionally heat the stellar atmosphere. These effects are also included in our models. We examine the impact of the flare-accelerated particle beams on model solar and dMe stellar atmospheres and perform parameter studies varying the injected particle energy spectra. We find the atmospheric response is strongly dependent on the accelerated particle cutoff energy and spectral index.},

	Abstract = {We present a homogeneous analysis of line and continuum emission from simultaneous high-cadence spectra and photometry covering near-ultraviolet and optical wavelengths for 20 M dwarf flares. These data were obtained to study the white-light continuum components at bluer and redder wavelengths than the Balmer jump. Our goals were to break the degeneracy between emission mechanisms that have been fit to broadband colors of flares and to provide constraints for radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) flare models that seek to reproduce the white-light flare emission. The main results from the analysis are the following: (1) the detection of Balmer continuum (in emission) that is present during all flares and with a wide range of relative contributions to the continuum flux at bluer wavelengths than the Balmer jump; (2) a blue continuum at flare maximum that is linearly decreasing with wavelength from lambda = 4000-4800 {\AA}, indicative of hot, blackbody emission with typical temperatures of T BB ~ 9000-14, 000 K (3) a redder continuum apparent at wavelengths longer than Hbeta (lambda >~ 4900 {\AA}) which becomes relatively more important to the energy budget during the late gradual phase. The hot blackbody component and redder continuum component have been detected in previous studies of flares. However, we have found that although the hot blackbody emission component is relatively well-represented by a featureless, single-temperature Planck function, this component includes absorption features and has a continuum shape strikingly similar to the spectrum of an A-type star as directly observed in our flare spectra. New model constraints are presented for the time evolution among the hydrogen Balmer lines and between Ca II K and the blackbody continuum emission. We calculate Balmer jump flux ratios and compare to the solar-type flare heating predictions from RHD models. The model ratios are too large and the blue-optical (lambda = 4000-4800 {\AA}) slopes are too red in both the impulsive and gradual decay phases of all 20 flares. This discrepancy implies that further work is needed to understand the heating at high column mass during dMe flares.

@article{kow15b,
	Abstract = {The heating mechanism at high densities during M-dwarf flares is poorly understood. Spectra of M-dwarf flares in the optical and near-ultraviolet wavelength regimes have revealed three continuum components during the impulsive phase: 1) an energetically dominant blackbody component with a color temperature of T≈104 K in the blue-optical, 2) a smaller amount of Balmer continuum emission in the near-ultraviolet at lambda<=3 646 {\AA}, and 3) an apparent pseudo-continuum of blended high-order Balmer lines between lambda=3 646 {\AA} and lambda≈3 900 {\AA}. These properties are not reproduced by models that employ a typical "solar-type" flare heating level of <= 10^{11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in nonthermal electrons, and therefore our understanding of these spectra is limited to a phenomenological three-component interpretation. We present a new 1D radiative-hydrodynamic model of an M-dwarf flare from precipitating nonthermal electrons with a high energy flux of 10^{13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The simulation produces bright near-ultraviolet and optical continuum emission from a dense (n>10^{15} cm^{-3}), hot (T ≈12 000 - 13 500 K) chromospheric condensation. For the first time, the observed color temperature and Balmer jump ratio are produced self-consistently in a radiative-hydrodynamic flare model. We find that a T≈104 K blackbody-like continuum component and a low Balmer jump ratio result from optically thick Balmer (∞--> n=2) and Paschen recombination (∞--> n=3) radiation, and thus the properties of the flux spectrum are caused by blue (lambda≈4 300 {\AA}) light escaping over a larger physical depth range than by red (lambda≈6 700 {\AA}) and near-ultraviolet (lambda≈3 500 {\AA}) light. To model the near-ultraviolet pseudo-continuum previously attributed to overlapping Balmer lines, we include the extra Balmer continuum opacity from Landau-Zener transitions that result from merged, high-order energy levels of hydrogen in a dense, partially ionized atmosphere. This reveals a new diagnostic of ambient charge density in the densest regions of the atmosphere that are heated during dMe and solar flares.},

	Abstract = {We analyze optical spectra of a two-ribbon, long-duration C1.1 flare that occurred on 2011 August 18 within AR 11271 (SOL2011-08-18T15:15). The impulsive phase of the flare was observed with a comprehensive set of space-borne and ground-based instruments, which provide a range of unique diagnostics of the lower flaring atmosphere. Here we report the detection of enhanced continuum emission, observed in low-resolution spectra from 3600 {\AA} to 4550 {\AA} acquired with the Horizontal Spectrograph at the Dunn Solar Telescope. A small, <=0.''5 (1015 cm2) penumbral/umbral kernel brightens repeatedly in the optical continuum and chromospheric emission lines, similar to the temporal characteristics of the hard X-ray variation as detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi spacecraft. Radiative-hydrodynamic flare models that employ a nonthermal electron beam energy flux high enough to produce the optical contrast in our flare spectra would predict a large Balmer jump in emission, indicative of hydrogen recombination radiation from the upper flare chromosphere. However, we find no evidence of such a Balmer jump in the bluemost spectral region of the continuum excess. Just redward of the expected Balmer jump, we find evidence of a "blue continuum bump" in the excess emission which may be indicative of the merging of the higher order Balmer lines. The large number of observational constraints provides a springboard for modeling the blue/optical emission for this particular flare with radiative-hydrodynamic codes, which are necessary to understand the opacity effects for the continuum and emission line radiation at these wavelengths.},

@article{bou16,
	Abstract = {Context. The evolution of lithium abundance in cool dwarfs provides a unique probe of nonstandard processes in stellar evolution.  Aims: We investigate the lithium content of young low-mass stars in the 5 Myr old, star forming region NGC 2264 and its relationship with rotation.  Methods: We combine lithium equivalent width measurements (EW(Li)) from the Gaia-ESO Survey with the determination of rotational periods from the CSI 2264 survey. We only consider bona fide nonaccreting cluster members to minimize the uncertainties on EW(Li).  Results: We report the existence of a relationship between lithium content and rotation in NGC 2264 at an age of 5 Myr. The Li-rotation connection is seen over a restricted temperature range (Teff = 3800-4400 K), where fast rotators are Li-rich compared to slow rotators. This correlation is similar to, albeit of lower amplitude than, the Li-rotation connection previously reported for K dwarfs in the 125 Myr old Pleiades cluster. We investigate whether the nonstandard pre-main-sequence models developed so far to explain the Pleiades results, which are based on episodic accretion, pre-main-sequence, core-envelope decoupling, and/or radius inflation due to enhanced magnetic activity, can account for early development of the Li-rotation connection. While radius inflation appears to be the most promising possibility, each of these models has issues. We therefore also discuss external causes that might operate during the first few Myr of pre-main-sequence evolution, such as planet engulfment and/or steady disk accretion, as possible candidates for the common origin for Li excess and fast rotation in young low-mass pre-main-sequence stars.  Conclusions: The emergence of a connection between lithium content and rotation rate at such an early age as 5 Myr suggests a complex link between accretion processes, early angular momentum evolution, and possibly planet formation, which likely impacts early stellar evolution and has yet to be fully deciphered.

	Abstract = {We characterise the relation between the gas and dust content of the interstellar medium towards young stellar objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster. X-ray observations provide estimates of the absorbing equivalent hydrogen column density N_H based on spectral fits. Near-infrared extinction values are calculated from intrinsic and observed colour magnitudes (J-H) and (H-K_s) as given by the VISTA Orion A survey. A linear fit of the correlation between column density and extinction values A_V yields an estimate of the N_H/A_V ratio. We investigate systematic uncertainties of the results by describing and (if possible) quantifying the influence of circumstellar material and the adopted extinction law, X-ray models, and elemental abundances on the N_H/A_V ratio. Assuming a Galactic extinction law with R_V=3.1 and solar abundances by Anders & Grevesse (1989), we deduce an N_H/A_V ratio of (1.39 +- 0.14) x 10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1 for Class III sources in the Orion Nebula Cluster where the given error does not include systematic uncertainties. This ratio is consistent with similar studies in other star-forming regions and approximately 31% lower than the Galactic value. We find no obvious trends in the spatial distribution of N_H/A_V ratios. Changes in the assumed extinction law and elemental abundances are demonstrated to have a relevant impact on deduced A_V and N_H values, respectively. Large systematic uncertainties associated with metal abundances in the Orion Nebula Cluster represent the primary limitation for the deduction of a definitive N_H/A_V ratio and the physical interpretation of these results.},

@article{tes16a,
	Abstract = {The study of the properties of disks around young brown dwarfs can provide important clues on the formation of these very low-mass objects and on the possibility of forming planetary systems around them. The presence of warm dusty disks around brown dwarfs is well known, based on near- and mid-infrared studies. High angular resolution observations of the cold outer disk are limited; we used ALMA to attempt a first survey of young brown dwarfs in the $\rho$-Oph star-forming region. All 17 young brown dwarfs in our sample were observed at 890 $\mu $m in the continuum at $\sim0.\!^{\prime\prime}5$ angular resolution. The sensitivity of our observations was chosen to detect $\sim0.5$ M$_\oplus$ of dust. We detect continuum emission in 11 disks ($\sim65$\%\ of the total), and the estimated mass of dust in the detected disks ranges from $\sim0.5$ to $\sim6$ M$_\oplus$. These disk masses imply that planet formation around brown dwarfs may be relatively rare and that the supra-Jupiter mass companions found around some brown dwarfs are probably the result of a binary system formation. We find evidence that the two brightest disks in $\rho$-Oph have sharp outer edges at R<~25 AU, in contrast to disks around Taurus brown dwarfs. This difference may suggest that the different environment in $\rho$-Oph may lead to significant differences in disk properties. A comparison of the M$_{disk}$/M$_\ast$ ratio for brown dwarf and solar-mass systems also shows a possible deficit of mass in brown dwarfs, which could support the evidence for dynamical truncation of disks in the substellar regime. These findings are still tentative and need to be put on firmer grounds by studying the gaseous disks around brown dwarfs and by performing a more systematic and unbiased survey of the disk population around the more massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Hot Jupiters are giant Jupiter-like exoplanets that orbit 100x closer to their host stars than Jupiter does to the Sun. These planets presumably form in the outer part of the primordial disc from which both the central star and surrounding planets are born, then migrate inwards and yet avoid falling into their host star. It is however unclear whether this occurs early in the lives of hot Jupiters, when still embedded within protoplanetary discs, or later, once multiple planets are formed and interact. Although numerous hot Jupiters were detected around mature Sun-like stars, their existence has not yet been firmly demonstrated for young stars, whose magnetic activity is so intense that it overshadows the radial velocity signal that close-in giant planets can induce. Here we show that hot Jupiters around young stars can be revealed from extended sets of high-resolution spectra. Once filtered-out from the activity, radial velocities of V830 Tau derived from new data collected in late 2015 exhibit a sine wave of period 4.93 d and semi-amplitude 75 m/ s, detected with a false alarm probability <0.03%. We find that this signal is fully unrelated to the 2.741-d rotation period of V830 Tau and we attribute it to the presence of a 0.77 Jupiter mass planet orbiting at a distance of 0.057 au from the host star. Our result demonstrates that hot Jupiters can migrate inwards in <2 Myr, most likely as a result of planet-disc interactions, and thus yields strong support to the theory of giant planet migration in gaseous protoplanetary discs.},

	Abstract = {The gas and dust are spatially segregated in protoplanetary disks due to the vertical settling and radial drift of large grains. A fuller accounting of the mass content and distribution in disks therefore requires spectral line observations. We extend the modeling approach presented in Williams & Best (2014) to show that gas surface density profiles can be measured from high fidelity 13CO integrated intensity images. We demonstrate the methodology by fitting ALMA observations of the HD 163296 disk to determine a gas mass, Mgas = 0.048 solar masse, and accretion disk characteristic size Rc = 213au and gradient gamma = 0.39. The same parameters match the C18O 2--1 image and indicates an abundance ratio [13CO]/[C18O] of 700 independent of radius. To test how well this methodology can be applied to future line surveys of smaller, lower mass T Tauri disks, we create a large 13CO 2--1 image library and fit simulated data. For disks with gas masses 3-10 Jupiter masses at 150pc, ALMA observations with a resolution of 0.2-0.3 arcseconds and integration times of about 20 minutes allow reliable estimates of Rc to within about 10au and gamma to within about 0.2. Economic gas imaging surveys are therefore feasible and offer the opportunity to open up a new dimension for studying disk structure and its evolution toward planet formation.},

	Abstract = {The space telescope CoRoT has provided light curves of T Tauri stars belonging to the star-forming region of NGC 2264 with unprecedented continuity and precision in the framework of a coordinated multi-wavelength observational project. We perform spot modelling of the optical light curves of five weak-line T Tauri stars whose variability is dominated by starspots. We apply two-spot and evolving single spot models in the framework of a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to derive the a posteriori distribution of the starspot parameters and the inclination of the star rotation axis. We focus on the rotation periods of the spots that can provide evidence for differential rotation in those stars. We find meaningful results in the case of three stars with an inclination higher than 50 deg and a slow variation of the light curve amplitude. The relative difference of the spot rotation periods ranges from 0.02 to 0.05 that is 3-10 times larger than the amplitude of the differential rotation found in similar stars with Doppler imaging techniques. We conclude that the intrinsic starspot evolution, although very slow, has a significant impact on the determination of the differential rotation by means of our spot modelling approach. We estimate typical timescales for the evolution of the starspot pattern between about 20 and 50 rotation periods in our stars.},

@article{woo06a,
	Abstract = {The solar X-ray radiation varies more than other wavelengths during flares; thus solar X-ray irradiance measurements are relied upon for detecting flare events as well as used to study flare parameters. There is new information about the spectral and temporal variations of flares using solar irradiance measurements from NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED) missions. For one, the improved measurement precision for the total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements by the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) has enabled the first detection of flares in the TSI. These flare observations indicate a total flare energy that is about 105 times more than the X-ray measurements in the 0.1-0.8 nm range. In addition, solar spectral irradiance instruments aboard TIMED and SORCE have observed hundreds of flare events in the 0.1 nm to 190 nm range. These solar ultraviolet measurements show that the ultraviolet irradiance changes during flares account for 50% or more of the flare variations seen in the TSI, with most of the ultraviolet contribution coming from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm. The remaining part of the flare energy is assumed to come from the wavelengths longward of 190 nm, typically only needing to be about 100 ppm increase for the largest flares. Another result is that the flare variations in the TSI have a strong limb darkening effect, whereby the flares near the limb indicate variations in the TSI being almost entirely from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm.},

	Abstract = {We compare the observed center-to-limb distribution of 86 white-light flares (WLFs) with calculated distributions derived from five flare models, each covering different heights, temperatures, and densities in the solar atmosphere. Considering the limited statistics and the possibility of selection effects in reporting WLFs, the following results may be considered tentative: (1) WLFs cannot be modeled solely by high-altitude optically thin sources, by optically thin chromospheric sources, or by photospheric sources located less than 150 km above the tau(5000) = 1 level; (2) middle photospheric sources extending somewhat higher than 150 km provide the best fit to the observed center-to-limb distribution; and (3) middle photospheric sources not exceeding 150 km altitude combined with chromospheric or higher-altitude sources are acceptable. An important feature of this work is that the methods used in the analysis are entirely independent of spectral analysis; yet spectral analysis has provided evidence for both photospheric and chromospheric components in WLFs.},

	Abstract = {We report the first direct imaging of protoplanetary disks in the star-forming region of Carina, the most distant, massive cluster in which disks have been imaged. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), disks are observed around two young stellar objects (YSOs) that are embedded inside evaporating gaseous globules and exhibit jet activity. The disks have an average size of 120 AU and total masses of 30 and 50 M_Jup. Given the measured masses, the minimum timescale required for planet formation (~1-2 Myr) and the average age of the Carina population (~1-4 Myr), it is plausible that young planets are present or their formation is currently ongoing in these disks. The non-detection of millimeter emission above the 4sigma threshold (~7 M_Jup) in the core of the massive cluster Trumpler~14, an area containing previously identified proplyd candidates, suggest evidence for rapid photo-evaporative disk destruction in the cluster's harsh radiation field. This would prevent the formation of giant gas planets in disks located in the cores of Carina's dense sub-clusters, whereas the majority of YSO disks in the wider Carina region remain unaffected by external photo-evaporation.},

We also have performed spectroscopy on a large majority of the previously known members of NGC 1333 in order to provide spectral classifications that are measured with the same scheme that has been applied to IC 348 in previous studies. The new census of members is nearly complete for Ks<16.8 at Aj<1.5 in IC 348 and for Ks<16.2 at Aj<3 in NGC 1333, which correspond to masses of <=0.01 Msun for ages of 3 Myr according to theoretical evolutionary models. The faintest known members extend below these completeness limits and appear to have masses of ~0.005 Msun. In extinction-limited samples of cluster members, NGC 1333 exhibits a higher abundance of objects at lower masses than IC 348. It would be surprising if the initial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their similar stellar densities and formation environments. Instead, it is possible that average extinctions are lower for less massive members of star-forming clusters, in which case extinction-limited samples could be biased in favor of low-mass objects in the more heavily embedded clusters like NGC 1333. In the H-R diagram, the median sequences of IC 348 and NGC 1333 coincide with each other for the adopted distances of 300 and 235 pc, which would suggest that they have similar ages. However, NGC 1333 is widely believed to be younger than IC 348 based on its higher abundance of disks and protostars and its greater obscuration. Errors in the adopted distances may be responsible for this discrepancy.},

	Abstract = {We present results of a spectroscopic survey for new K- and M-type members of Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), the nearest OB Association (~100-200 pc). Using an X-ray, proper motion and color-magnitude selected sample, we obtained spectra for 361 stars, for which we report spectral classifications and Li and Halpha equivalent widths. We identified 156 new members of Sco-Cen, and recovered 51 previously published members. We have combined these with previously known members to form a sample of 493 solar-mass (~0.7-1.3 Msun) members of Sco-Cen. We investigated the star-formation history of this sample, and re-assessed the ages of the massive main-sequence turn-off and the G-type members in all three subgroups. We performed a census for circumstellar disks in our sample using WISE infrared data and find a protoplanetary disk fraction for K-type stars of 4.4$^{+1.6}_{-0.9}$% for Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux at ~16 Myr and 9.0$^{+4.0}_{-2.2}$% for Upper Scorpius at ~10 Myr. These data are consistent with a protoplanetary disk e-folding timescale of ~4-5 Myr for ~1 Msun stars, twice that previously quoted (Mamajek 2009), but consistent with the Bell et al. revised age scale of young clusters. Finally, we construct an age map of Scorpius-Centaurus which clearly reveals substructure consisting of concentrations of younger and older stars. We find evidence for strong age gradients within all three subgroups. None of the subgroups are consistent with being simple, coeval populations which formed in single bursts, but likely represents a multitude of smaller star formation episodes of hundreds to tens of stars each.},

	Abstract = {Here we present the first results from ALMA observations of 1 mm polarized dust emission towards the W43-MM1 high mass star forming clump. We have detected a highly fragmented filament with source masses ranging from 14Msun to 312Msun, where the largest fragment, source A, is believed to be one of the most massive in our Galaxy. We found a smooth, ordered, and detailed polarization pattern throughout the filament which we used to derived magnetic field morphologies and strengths for 12 out of the 15 fragments detected ranging from 0.2 to 9 mG. The dynamical equilibrium of each fragment was evaluated finding that all the fragments are in a super-critical state which is consistent with previously detected infalling motions towards W43-MM1. Moreover, there are indications suggesting that the field is being dragged by gravity as the whole filament is collapsing.},

@article{joh16a,
	Abstract = {The ~2 Myr old classical T Tauri star CI Tau shows periodic variability in its radial velocity (RV) variations measured at infrared (IR) and optical wavelengths. We find that these observations are consistent with a massive planet in a ~9-day period orbit. These results are based on 71 IR RV measurements of this system obtained over 5 years, and on 26 optical RV measurements obtained over 9 years. CI Tau was also observed photometrically in the optical on 34 nights over ~one month in 2012. The optical RV data alone are inadequate to identify an orbital period, likely the result of star spot and activity induced noise for this relatively small dataset. The infrared RV measurements reveal significant periodicity at ~9 days. In addition, the full set of optical and IR RV measurements taken together phase coherently and with equal amplitudes to the ~9 day period. Periodic radial velocity signals can in principle be produced by cool spots, hot spots, and reflection of the stellar spectrum off the inner disk, in addition to resulting from a planetary companion. We have considered each of these and find the planet hypothesis most consistent with the data. The radial velocity amplitude yields an Msin(i) of ~8.1 M_Jup; in conjunction with a 1.3 mm continuum emission measurement of the circumstellar disk inclination from the literature, we find a planet mass of ~11.3 M_Jup, assuming alignment of the planetary orbit with the disk.},

	Abstract = {Star formation in molecular clouds can be triggered by the dynamical action of winds from massive stars. Furthermore, X-ray and UV fluxes from massive stars can influence the life time of surrounding circumstellar disks. We present the results of a 53 ks XMM-Newton observation centered on the Rho Ophiuchi A+B binary system. Rho Ophiiuchi lies in the center of a ring of dust, likely formed by the action of its winds. This region is different from the dense core of the cloud (L1688 Core F) where star formation is at work. X-rays are detected from Rho Ophiuchi as well as a group of surrounding X-ray sources. We detected 89 X-ray sources, 47 of them have at least one counterpart in 2MASS + All-WISE catalogs. Based on IR and X-ray properties, we can distinguish between young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the cloud and background objects. Among the cloud members, we detect 3 debris disk objects and 22 disk-less / Class III young stars. We show that these stars have ages in $5-10$ Myr, and are significantly older than the YSOs in L1688. We speculate that they are the result of an early burst of star formation in the cloud. An X-ray energy of $\ge5\times10^{44}$ ergs has been injected into the surrounding medium during the past $5$ Myr, we discuss the effects of such energy budget in relation to the cloud properties and dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We present ALMA observations of 106 G-, K-, and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius OB Association hosting circumstellar disks. With these data, we measure the 0.88 mm continuum and $^{12}$CO $J = 3-2$ line fluxes of disks around low mass ($0.14-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$) stars at an age of 5-11 Myr. Of the 75 primordial disks in the sample, 53 are detected in the dust continuum and 26 in CO. Of the 31 disks classified as debris/evolved transitional disks, 5 are detected in the continuum and none in CO. The lack of CO emission in approximately half of the disks with detected continuum emission can be explained if CO is optically thick but has a compact emitting area ($\lesssim 40$ AU), or if the CO is heavily depleted by a factor of at least $\sim1000$ relative to interstellar medium abundances and is optically thin. The continuum measurements are used to estimate the dust mass of the disks. We find a correlation between disk dust mass and stellar host mass consistent with a power-law relation of $M_{dust}\propto M_*^{1.67\pm0.37}$. Disk dust masses in Upper Sco are compared to those measured in the younger Taurus star forming region to constrain the evolution of disk dust mass. We find that the difference in the mean of $\log(M_{dust}/M_*)$ between Taurus and Upper Sco is $0.64\pm0.09$, such that $M_{dust}/M_*$ is lower in Upper Sco by a factor of $\sim4.5$.},

	Abstract = {Most existing studies of the angular momentum evolution of young stellar populations have focused on the youngest (1-3 Myr) T Tauri stars. In contrast, the angular momentum distributions of older T Tauri stars (4-10 Myr) have been less studied, even though they hold key insight to understanding stellar angular momentum evolution at a time when protoplanetary disks have largely dissipated and when models therefore predict changes in the rotational evolution that can in principle be tested. We present a study of photometric variability among 1,974 confirmed T Tauri members of various sub-regions of the Orion OB1 association, and with ages spanning 4-10 Myr, using optical time-series from three different surveys. For 564 of the stars (~32% of the weak-lined T Tauri stars and ~13% of the classical T Tauri stars in our sample) we detect statistically significant periodic variations which we attribute to the stellar rotation periods, making this one of the largest samples of T Tauri star rotation periods yet published. We observe a clear change in the overall rotation period distributions over the age range 4-10 Myr, with the progressively older sub-populations exhibiting systematically faster rotation. This result is consistent with angular momentum evolution model predictions of an important qualitative change in the stellar rotation periods starting at ~5 Myr, an age range for which very few observational constraints were previously available.},

@article{wei03a,
	Abstract = {In the previous papers in this series, we found that radiative torques can play a major role in the alignment of grains with the interstellar magnetic field. Since the radiative torques can drive the grains to suprathermal rotational speeds, in previous work we made the simplifying assumption that the grain principal axis of greatest moment of inertia is always parallel to the grain angular momentum. This enabled us to describe many of the features of the grain dynamics. However, this assumption fails when the grains enter periods of thermal rotation, which occur naturally in the radiative torque alignment scenario. In the present paper we relax this assumption and explore the consequences for the grain dynamics. We develop a treatment to follow the grain dynamics, including thermal fluctuations and ``thermal flipping,'' and show results for one illustrative example. By comparing with a treatment without thermal fluctuations, we see that inclusion of thermal fluctuations can lead to qualitative changes in the grain dynamics. In future installments in this series, we will use the more complete dynamical treatment developed here to perform a systematic study of grain alignment by radiative torques and test the model against observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission from dust.},

	Abstract = {Context: CoRoT is a space telescope dedicated to stellar seismology and the search for extrasolar planets. The mission is led by the CNES in association with French laboratories and has a large international participation. The European Space Agency (ESA), Austria, Belgium, and Germany contribute to the payload, and Spain and Brazil contribute to the ground segment. Development of the spacecraft, which is based on a PROTEUS low earth orbit (LEO) recurrent platform, commenced in October 2000, and the satellite was launched on December 27, 2006.   Aims: The instrument and platform characteristics prior to launch have been described in ESA publication (SP-1306). In the present paper we explain the behaviour in flight, based on raw and corrected data.   Methods: Five runs have been completed since January 2007. The data used here are essentially those acquired during the commissioning phase and from a long run that lasted 146 days. These enable us to give a complete overview of the instrument and platform behaviour for all environmental conditions. The ground based data processing is not described in detail because the most important method has been published elsewhere. Results: We show that the performance specifications are easily satisfied when the environmental conditions are favourable. Most of the perturbations, hence data corrections, are related to LEO perturbations: high energy particles inside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), eclipses and temperature variations, and line of sight fluctuations due to the attitude control system. Straylight due to the reflected light from the earth, which is controlled by the telescope and baffle design, appears to be negligible.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with contributions from Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany and Spain.  Four French laboratories associated with the CNRS (LESIA, LAM, IAS, OMP) collaborate with CNES on the satellite development. The authors are grateful to Ian Roxburgh for a careful reading of the manuscript.},

	Abstract = {Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs by high energy radiation from the central young stellar object is currently the favourite model to explain the sudden dispersal of discs from the inside out. While several theoretical works have provided a detailed pictured of this process, the direct observational validation is still lacking. Emission lines produced in these slow moving protoplanetary disc winds may bear the imprint of the wind structure and thus provide a potential diagnostic of the underlying dispersal process. In this paper we primarily focus on the collisionally excited neutral oxygen line at 6300A. We compare our models predictions to observational data and demonstrate a thermal origin for the observed blueshifted low-velocity component of this line from protoplanetary discs. Furthermore our models show that while this line is a clear tell-tale-sign of a warm, quasi-neutral disc wind, typical of X-ray photoevaporation, its strong temperature dependence makes it unsuitable to measure detailed wind quantities like mass-loss-rate.},

	Abstract = {A search for dips in observed stellar flux in the Upper Scorpius and $\rho$ Ophiuchus star formation regions with the Kepler mission by Ansdell et al. primarily identified young, low mass stars (dippers) with low accretion rates and hosting moderately evolved dusty circumstellar disks. These young stars likely exhibit rotating star spots that cause quasi-periodic photometric variations. However, a separate period associated with the dips is not evident in spectrograms constructed from the light curves. The material causing the dips in most of these light curves must be approximately corotating with the star. We find that disk temperatures computed at the disk corotation radius are cool enough that dust should not sublimate. Dippers are preferentially associated with young, low mass stars as they have low enough luminosities to allow dust to survive within a few stellar radii. Crude estimates for stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates are consistent with magnetospheric truncation near the corotation radius. Magnetospheric truncation models can explain why dusty material is lifted out of the midplane to obscure the star causing the light curve dips and why so many young low mass stars are dippers. We propose that variations in disk orientation angle, stellar magnetic field dipole tilt axis, and disk accretion rate are underlying parameters accounting for differences in the dipper light curves.},

	Abstract = {A relation between the mass accretion rate onto the central young star and the mass of the surrounding protoplanetary disk has long been theoretically predicted and observationally sought. For the first time, we have accurately and homogeneously determined the photospheric parameters, the mass accretion rate, and the disk mass for an essentially complete sample of young stars with disks in the Lupus clouds. Our work combines the results of surveys conducted with VLT/X-Shooter and ALMA. With this dataset we are able to test a basic prediction of viscous accretion theory, the existence of a linear relation between the mass accretion rate onto the central star and the total disk mass. We find a correlation between the mass accretion rate and the disk dust mass, with a ratio that is roughly consistent with the expected viscous timescale when assuming an ISM gas-to-dust ratio. This confirms that mass accretion rates are related to the properties of the outer disk. We find no correlation between mass accretion rates and the disk mass measured by CO isotopologues emission lines, possibly due to the small number of measured disk gas masses. This suggests that the mm-sized dust mass better traces the total disk mass and that masses derived from CO may be underestimated, at least in some cases.},

@article{nel16a,
	Abstract = {(abridged) We present 2-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code, VINE, to model a self-gravitating binary system similar to the GG Tau A system. We simulate systems configured with semi-major axes of either $a=62$~AU (`wide') or $a=32$~AU (`close'), and with eccentricity of either $e=0$ or $e=0.3$. Strong spiral structures are generated with large material streams extending inwards. A small fraction accretes onto the circumstellar disks, with most returning to the torus. Structures also propagate outwards, generating net outwards mass flow and eventually losing coherence at large distances. The torus becomes significantly eccentric in shape. Accretion onto the stars occurs at a rate of a few $\times10^{-8}$\msun/yr implying disk lifetimes shorter than $\sim10^4$~yr, without replenishment. Only wide configurations retain disks by virtue of robust accretion. In eccentric configurations, accretion is episodic, occurs preferentially onto the secondary at wrates peaked near binary periapse. We conclude that the \ggtaua\ torus is strongly self gravitating and that a major contribution to its thermal energy is shock dissipation. We interpret its observed features as manifestations of spiral structures and the low density material surrounding it as an excretion disk created by outward mass flux. We interpret GG Tau A as a coplanar system with an eccentric torus, and account for its supposed mutual inclination as due to degeneracy between the interpretation of inclination and eccentricity. Although the disks persist for long enough to permit planet formation, the environment remains unfavorable due to high temperatures. We conclude that the GG Tau A system is in an eccentric, $a\sim62$~AU orbit.},

@article{van10a,
	Abstract = {Context. The southern ``infrared companion'' of T Tau is known to show strong photometric variations of several magnitudes on timescales of years, as well as more modest ⪅1 mag variations on timescales as short as one week. The physical mechanism driving these variations is debated, intrinsic luminosity variations due to a variable accretion rate were initially proposed, but later challenged in favor of apparent fluctuations due to time-variable foreground extinction.  Aims: We seek to investigate the nature of the observed photometric variability. Based on simple geometric arguments and basic physics laws, a minimum variability timescale can be derived for which variable extinction is a viable mechanism. Because this timescale increases rapidly with wavelength, observations at long wavelengths provide the strongest constraints.  Methods: We used VISIR at the VLT to image the T Tau system at two epochs in February 2008, separated by 3.94 days. In addition we compiled an extensive set of near- and mid-infrared photometric data from the literature, supplemented by a number of previously unpublished measurements, and constructed light curves for the various system components. We constructed a 2D radiative transfer model for the disk of T Tau Sa, consisting of a passively irradiated dusty outer part and a central, actively accreting component.  Results: Our VISIR data reveal a +26 $\pm$ 2% change in the T Tau S/T Tau N flux ratio at 12.8 mum within four days, which can be attributed to a brightening of T Tau Sa. Variable extinction can be excluded as a viable mechanism for the observed flux variation based on the short timescale and the long observing wavelength. We show that also the high long-term photometric variability and its associated color-magnitude behavior can be plausibly explained with variable accretion. However, variable extinction is also a viable mechanism for the long-term variability, and a combination of both mechanisms may be required to explain the collective photometric variability of Sa.  Conclusions: We conclude that the observed short-term variability is caused by a variable accretion luminosity in T Tau Sa, which leads to substantial fluctuations in the irradiation of the disk surface and thus induces rapid variations in the disk surface temperature and IR brightness. Both variable accretion and variable foreground extinction can plausibly explain the long-term color and brightness variations. We suggest that the periods of high and variable brightness of Sa that we witnessed in the early and late 1990s were due to enhanced accretion induced by the periastron passage of Sb, which gravitationally perturbed the Sa disk.  Based on observations obtained at ESO's La Silla/Paranal observatory under programmes 280.C-5035, 068.D-0537, 070.C-0544, 070.C-0162, 072.C-0593, 074.C-0699, 074.C-0396, 078.C-0386, 380.C-0179, 382.C-0324, and 084.C-0783, as well as observations obtained at UKIRT.},

	Abstract = {This work treats the matter deceleration in a magnetohydrodynamic radiative shock wave at the surface of a star. The problem is relevant to classical T Tauri stars where infalling matter is channelled along the star's magnetic field and stopped in the dense layers of photosphere. A significant new aspect of this work is that the magnetic field has an arbitrary angle with respect to the normal to the star's surface. We consider the limit where the magnetic field at the surface of the star is not very strong in the sense that the inflow is super-Alfv{\'e}nic. In this limit, the initial deceleration and heating of plasma (at the entrance to the cooling zone) occurs in a fast magnetohydrodynamic shock wave. To calculate the intensity of radiative losses we use `real' and `power-law' radiative functions. We determine the stability/instability of the radiative shock wave as a function of parameters of the incoming flow: velocity, strength of the magnetic field, and its inclination to the surface of the star. In a number of simulation runs with the `real' radiative function, we find a simple criterion for stability of the radiative shock wave. For a wide range of parameters, the periods of oscillation of the shock wave are of the order of 0.02-0.2s.},

@article{sta99a,
	Abstract = {We employ a Monte Carlo radiation transfer code to investigate the multiwavelength photopolarimetric variability arising from a spotted T Tauri star surrounded by a dusty circumstellar disk. Our aim is to assess the ability of the magnetic accretion model to explain the observed photopolarimetric variability of classical T Tauri stars and to identify potentially useful observational diagnostics of T Tauri star/disk/spot parameters. We model a range of spot sizes, spot latitudes, inner disk truncation radii, and system inclination angles, as well as multiple disk and spot geometries. We find that the amplitude, morphology, and wavelength-dependence of the photopolarimetric variability predicted by our models are generally consistent with existing observations; a flared disk geometry is required to reproduce the largest observed polarization levels and variations. Our models can further explain stochastic polarimetric variability if unsteady accretion is invoked, in which case irregular (but correlated) photometric variability is predicted, in agreement with observations. We find that variability in percent polarization is by itself an unreliable diagnostic, because certain system geometries do not produce any variability in linear polarization (contrary to the commonly held notion that hot spots will necessarily produce periodic polarimetric variability). Observations of variability in polarization position angle, however, could provide useful constraints on system inclination. The observation of wavelength-dependent polarization position angles, attributed by some to interstellar effects, is naturally explained by our models. Certain system geometries yield peculiar photometric light curve morphologies, the observation of which could also serve to constrain system inclination. We do not find useful diagnostics of disk truncation radius, nor do we find significant differences when we model the spots as rings. We also investigate the reliability of modeling spot parameters via analytic fits to multiband photometric variations. We find that commonly used analytic models consistently recover input model parameters but that inferred spot temperatures are more sensitive to uncertainties in the photometric data than previous modeling would suggest.},

	Abstract = {A computer-based catalogue of UBVRI photoelectric photometry of T Tauri stars and their earlier type analogs has been compiled. It presently includes over 10 000 entries on 80 stars and will be updated on a regular basis; it is available on Internet. The catalogue is used to analyze the sometimes bizarre light variations of pre-main-sequence stars on time scales of days to months in an attempt to illuminate the nature and causes of the phenomenon. It is useful in discussing their light variations to divide the stars into three groups according to their spectra. These are: weak T Tauri stars (WTTS; spectral class later than K0 and WH-alpha less than 10 A, classical T Tauri stars (CTTS; spectral class later than K0 and WH-alpha greater than 10 A), and early type T Tauri stars (ETTS; spectral class of K0 or earlier). Three distinct types of variability are displayed by stars in the catalogue. Type I variations are periodic in VRI and undoubtedly caused by rotational modulation of a star with an asymmetric distribution of cool spots on its surface. Irregular flare activity is sometimes seen on such stars in U and B. Type I variations are easiest to see on WTTS but are clearly present on CTTS and ETTS as well. Type II variations are caused by hot 'spots' or zones and, it is argued, result from changes in the excess or 'veiling' continuum commonly attributed to an accretion boundary layer or impact zone of a magnetically channeled accretion flow. This type of variation is seen predominantly or solely in CTTS. A sub-category, designated Type IIp, consists of stars which display periodic variations caused by hot spots. Whereas cool spots may last for hundreds or thousands of rotations, hot spots appear to come and go on a much shorter time scale. This suggests that both unsteady accretion and rotation of the star contribute to Type II variations. It is shown that a third type of variation exists among ETTS, including stars as early as A type. UX Ori is a typical example and we call these Type III variables or UXors. Their distinguishing characteristic is that they can display very large amplitudes (exceeding 2.8 mag in V) while showing little or no evidence for a veiling continuum or any substantial change in their photospheric spectra. If Type III variations are caused by changes in accretion luminosity, then boundary layers or impact zones in ETTS must be much different from CTTS which, of course, is possible since mass accretion rates are probably much higher. However, the leading hypothesis for explaining Type III variations is variable obscuration by circumstellar dust. <It is argued that the putative dust clumps causing such variations cannot be confined to a disk; otherwise UXors would be rare. &Perhaps magnetic effects are involved in levitating accreting dust out of the plane, as has been suggested for CTTS, or perhaps we are witnessing continuing infall of clumps from placental clouds. A third possibility is that dust may be condensing in an outflow.},

	Abstract = {Low-mass condensations (LMCs) are observed inside the envelope of the collapsing molecular cloud cores. In this research, we investigate the effects of landing LMCs for occurrence of instability through the protostellar accretion disks. We consider some regions of the disk where duration of infalling and landing of the LMCs are shorter than the orbital period. In this way, we can consider the landing LMCs as density bumps and grooves in the azimuthal direction of an initial thin axisymmetric steady state self-gravitating protostellar accretion disk (nearly Keplerian). Using the linear effects of the bump quantities, we obtain a characteristic equation for growth/decay rate of bumps; we numerically solve it to find occurrence of instability. We also evaluate the minimum-growth-time-scale (MGTS) and the enhanced mass accretion rate. The results show that infalling and landing of the LMCs in the inner regions of the protostellar accretion disks can cause faster unstable modes and less enhanced accretion rates relative to the outer regions. Also, more fragmentation of landed LMCs in the azimuthal direction have less chance for instability, and then can produce more values of enhanced mass accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {We present our investigation of 319 Class II objects in Orion A observed by $Spitzer$/IRS. We also present the follow-up observation of 120 of these Class II objects in Orion A from IRTF/SpeX. We measure continuum spectral indices, equivalent widths, and integrated fluxes that pertain to disk structure and dust composition from IRS spectra of Class II objects in Orion A. We estimate mass accretion rates using hydrogen recombination lines in the SpeX spectra of our targets. Utilizing these properties, we compare the distributions of the disk and dust properties of Orion A disks to those of Taurus disks with respect to position within Orion A (ONC and L1641) and to the sub-groups by the inferred radial structures, such as transitional disks vs. radially continuous full disks. Our main findings are as follows. (1) Inner disks evolve faster than the outer disks. (2) Mass accretion rate of transitional disks and that of radially continuous full disks are statistically significantly displaced from each other. The median mass accretion rate of radially continuous disks in ONC and L1641 is not very different from that in Taurus. (3) Less grain processing has occurred in the disks in ONC compared to those in Taurus, based on analysis of the shape index of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature ($F_{11.3}/F_{9.8}$). (4) The 20-31 $\mu$m continuum spectral index tracks the projected distance from the most luminous Trapezium star, $\theta^{1}$ Ori C. A possible explanation is the effect of UV ablation of the outer part of the disks.},

	Abstract = {Outflowing motions, whether a wind launched from the disk, a jet launched from the protostar, or the entrained molecular outflow, appear to be an ubiquitous feature of star formation. These outwards motions have a number of root causes, and how they manifest is intricately linked to their environment as well as the process of star formation itself. Using the ALMA Science Verification data of HL Tau, we investigate the high velocity molecular gas being removed from the system as a result of the star formation process. We aim to place these motions in context with the optically detected jet, and the disk. With these high resolution ($\sim 1"$) ALMA observations of CO (J=1-0), we quantify the outwards motions of the molecular gas. We find evidence for a bipolar outwards flow, with an opening angle, as measured in the red-shifted lobe, starting off at 90$^\circ$, and narrowing to 60$^\circ$ further from the disk, likely because of magnetic collimation. Its outwards velocity, corrected for inclination angle is of order 2.4 km s$^{-1}$.},

	Abstract = {We present results of pointed X-ray observations of the accreting jet-driving T Tauri star RY Tau using Chandra and XMM-Newton. We obtained high-resolution grating spectra and excellent-quality CCD spectra and light curves with the objective of identifying the physical mechanisms underlying RY Tau's bright X-ray emission. Grating spectra reveal numerous emission lines spanning a broad range of temperature superimposed on a hot continuum. The X-ray emission measure distribution is dominated by very hot plasma at T_hot ~ 50 MK but higher temperatures were present during flares. A weaker cool plasma component is also present as revealed by low-temperature lines such as O VIII. X-ray light curves show complex variability consisting of short-duration (~hours) superhot flares accompanied by fluorescent Fe emission at 6.4 keV superimposed on a slowly-varying (~one day) component that may be tied to stellar rotation. The hot flaring component is undoubtedly of magnetic (e.g. coronal) origin. Soft and hard-band light curves undergo similar slow variability implying that at least some of the cool plasma shares a common magnetic origin with the hot plasma. Any contribution to the X-ray emission from cool shocked plasma is small compared to the dominant hot component but production of individual low-temperature lines such as O VIII in an accretion shock is not ruled out.},

	Abstract = {Formation, evolution, and dispersal processes of protoplanetary disks are investigated and the disk lifetime is estimated. Gravitational collapse of a pre-stellar core forms both a central star and a protoplanetary disk. The central star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central star heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk dispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent pre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of typical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar core with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long, while a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime. Integrating the disk lifetimes under various mass and angular velocity of prestellar cores and X-ray luminosities of young stellar objects, we obtain disk fraction at a given stellar age and mean lifetime of the disks. Our model indicates that the mean lifetime of protoplanetary disks is 3.7 Myr, which is consistent with the observational estimate from young stellar clusters. We also find that the dispersion of X-ray luminosity is needed to reproduce the observed disk fraction.},

@article{cok16a,
	Abstract = {A concordance model for angular momentum evolution has been developed by multiple investigators. This approach postulates that star forming regions and clusters are an evolutionary sequence which can be modeled with assumptions about the coupling between protostars and accretion disks, angular momentum loss from magnetized winds that saturates in a mass-dependent fashion at high rotation rates, and core-envelope decoupling for solar analogs. We test this approach by combining established data with the large h Per dataset from the MONITOR project and new low-mass Pleiades data. We confirm prior results that young low-mass stars can be used to test star-disk coupling and angular momentum loss independent of the treatment of internal angular momentum transport. For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to evolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural post-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators from h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived disks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling. However, our wind models cannot evolve rapid rotators from h Per to older systems consistently; this appears to be a general problem for any wind model that becomes ineffective in low-mass young stars. We outline two possible solutions: either there is cosmic variance in the distribution of stellar rotation rates in different clusters or there are substantially enhanced torques in low-mass rapid rotators. We favor the former explanation and discuss observational tests that could be used to distinguish them. If the distribution of initial conditions depends on environment, models which test parameters by assuming a universal underlying distribution of initial conditions will need to be re-evaluated.},

	Abstract = {We present the ALMA Band 3 and Band 6 results of 12CO(2-1), 13$CO(2-1), H30alpha recombination line, free-free emission around 98 GHz, and the dust thermal emission around 230 GHz toward the N159 East Giant Molecular Cloud (N159E) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). LMC is the nearest active high-mass star forming face-on galaxy at a distance of 50 kpc and is the best target for studing high-mass star formation. ALMA observations show that N159E is the complex of filamentary clouds with the width and length of ~1 pc and 5 pc - 10 pc, respectively. The total molecular mass is 0.92 x 10^5 Msun from the 13CO(2-1) intensity. N159E harbors the well-known Papillon Nebula, a compact high-excitation HII region. We found that a YSO associated with the Papillon Nebula has the mass of 35 Msun and is located at the intersection of three filamentary clouds. It indicates that the formation of the high-mass YSO was induced by the collision of filamentary clouds. Fukui et al. 2015 reported a similar kinematic structure toward a YSO in the N159 West region which is another YSO that has the mass larger than 35 Msun in these two regions. This suggests that the collision of filamentary clouds is a primary mechanism of high-mass star formation. We found a small molecular hole around the YSO in Papillon Nebula with sub-pc scale. It is filled by free-free and H30alpha emission. Temperature of the molecular gas around the hole reaches ~ 80 K. It indicates that this YSO has just started the distruction of parental molecular cloud.},

	Abstract = {We present an overview of solar flares and associated phenomena, drawing upon a wide range of observational data primarily from the RHESSI era. Following an introductory discussion and overview of the status of observational capabilities, the article is split into topical sections which deal with different areas of flare phenomena (footpoints and ribbons, coronal sources, relationship to coronal mass ejections) and their interconnections. We also discuss flare soft X-ray spectroscopy and the energetics of the process. The emphasis is to describe the observations from multiple points of view, while bearing in mind the models that link them to each other and to theory. The present theoretical and observational understanding of solar flares is far from complete, so we conclude with a brief discussion of models, and a list of missing but important observations.},

@article{bur15a,
	Abstract = {We study the correlation between abrupt permanent changes of magnetic field during X-class flares observed by the Global Oscillation Network Group and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instruments, and the hard X-ray (HXR) emission observed by RHESSI, to relate the photospheric field changes to the coronal restructuring and investigate the origin of the field changes. We find that spatially the early RHESSI emission corresponds well to locations of the strong field changes. The field changes occur predominantly in the regions of strong magnetic field near the polarity inversion line (PIL). The later RHESSI emission does not correspond to significant field changes as the flare footpoints are moving away from the PIL. Most of the field changes start before or around the start time of the detectable HXR signal, and they end at about the same time or later than the detectable HXR flare emission. Some of the field changes propagate with speed close to that of the HXR footpoint at a later phase of the flare. The propagation of the field changes often takes place after the strongest peak in the HXR signal when the footpoints start moving away from the PIL, i.e., the field changes follow the same trajectory as the HXR footpoint, but at an earlier time. Thus, the field changes and HXR emission are spatio-temporally related but not co-spatial nor simultaneous. We also find that in the strongest X-class flares the amplitudes of the field changes peak a few minutes earlier than the peak of the HXR signal. We briefly discuss this observed time delay in terms of the formation of current sheets during eruptions.},

@article{shi11a,
	Abstract = {This paper outlines the current understanding of solar flares, mainly focused on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes responsible for producing a flare. Observations show that flares are one of the most explosive phenomena in the atmosphere of the Sun, releasing a huge amount of energy up to about 10^32 erg on the timescale of hours. Flares involve the heating of plasma, mass ejection, and particle acceleration that generates high-energy particles. The key physical processes for producing a flare are: the emergence of magnetic field from the solar interior to the solar atmosphere (flux emergence), local enhancement of electric current in the corona (formation of a current sheet), and rapid dissipation of electric current (magnetic reconnection) that causes shock heating, mass ejection, and particle acceleration. The evolution toward the onset of a flare is rather quasi-static when free energy is accumulated in the form of coronal electric current (field-aligned current, more precisely), while the dissipation of coronal current proceeds rapidly, producing various dynamic events that affect lower atmospheres such as the chromosphere and photosphere. Flares manifest such rapid dissipation of coronal current, and their theoretical modeling has been developed in accordance with observations, in which numerical simulations proved to be a strong tool reproducing the time-dependent, nonlinear evolution of a flare. We review the models proposed to explain the physical mechanism of flares, giving an comprehensive explanation of the key processes mentioned above. We start with basic properties of flares, then go into the details of energy build-up, release and transport in flares where magnetic reconnection works as the central engine to produce a flare.},

	Abstract = {This publication provides an overview of magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere with the focus lying on the corona. The solar magnetic field couples the solar interior with the visible surface of the Sun and with its atmosphere. It is also responsible for all solar activity in its numerous manifestations. Thus, dynamic phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and flares are magnetically driven. In addition, the field also plays a crucial role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona as well as in accelerating the solar wind. Our main emphasis is the magnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere so that photospheric and chromospheric magnetic structures are mainly discussed where relevant for higher solar layers. Also, the discussion of the solar atmosphere and activity is limited to those topics of direct relevance to the magnetic field. After giving a brief overview about the solar magnetic field in general and its global structure, we discuss in more detail the magnetic field in active regions, the quiet Sun and coronal holes.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The complex physics of close binary stars is made even more challenging by the proximity effects that affect it. Understanding the influence of these proximity effects is one of the most important tasks in theoretical stellar astrophysics. It is crucial to know how the specific intensity is distributed over the stellar disk for a correct modelling of the light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits. To provide theoretical input for light curve modelling codes, we present new calculations of gravity- and limb-darkening coefficients for a wide range of effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and microturbulent velocities.  Methods: We computed limb-darkening coefficients for several atmosphere models, which cover the transmission curves of the Kepler, CoRoT, and Spitzer space missions as well as more widely used passbands (Str{\"o}mgren, Johnson-Cousins, Sloan). In addition to these computations, which were made adopting the least-square method, we also performed calculations for the bi-parametric approximations by adopting the flux conservation method to provide users with an additional tool to estimate the theoretical error bars. To facilitate the modelling of the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the gravity-darkening coefficients y(lambda) using the same models of stellar atmospheres as for the limb-darkening. Compared to previous work, a more general differential equation was used, which now takes into account local gravity variations and the effects of convection.  Results: The limb-darkening coefficients were computed with a higher numerical resolution (100 mu points instead of 15 or 17, as is often used in the ATLAS models), and five equations were used to describe the specific intensities (linear, quadratic, root-square, logarithmic, and a 4-coefficient law). Concerning the gravity-darkening coefficients, the influence of the local gravity on y(lambda) is shown as well as the effects of convection, which turn out to be very significant for cool stars. The results are tabulated for log g's ranging from 0.0 to 5.0, -5.0 <= log [M/H] <= +1, 2000 K <= Teff <= 50 000 K and for five values of the microturbulent velocity. ATLAS and PHOENIX plane-parallel atmosphere models were used for all computations.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations of seven young and highly variable M dwarfs in star forming regions in Orion, conducted in 4 observing nights with FORS2 at ESO/VLT. All seven targets show significant photometric variability in the I-band, with amplitudes between 0.1-0.8 mag, The spectra, however, remain remarkably constant, with spectral type changes less than 0.5 subtypes. Thus, the brightness changes are not caused by veiling that 'fills in' absorption features. Three objects in the $\sigma$ Ori cluster (age $\sim$3 Myr) exhibit strong H$\alpha$ emission and H$\alpha$ variability, in addition to the continuum variations. Their behaviour is mostly consistent with the presence of spots with temperature of $\sim300$ K above the photosphere and filling factors between 0.2-0.4, in contrast to typical hot spots observed in more massive stars. The remaining targets near $\epsilon$ Ori, likely to be older, show eclipse-like lightcurves, no significant H$\alpha$ activity and are better represented by variable extinction due to circumstellar material. Interestingly, two of them show no evidence of infrared excess emission. Our study shows that high-amplitude variability in young very low mass stars can be caused by different phenomena than in more massive T Tauri stars and can persist when the disk has disappeared and accretion has ceased.},

	Abstract = {Transition disks (TDs) are intermediate stage circumstellar disks characterized by an inner gap within the disk structure. To test whether these gaps may have been formed by closely orbiting, previously undetected stellar companions, we collected high-resolution optical spectra of 31 TD objects to search for spectroscopic binaries (SBs). Twenty-four of these objects are in Ophiuchus and seven are within the Coronet, Corona Australis, and Chameleon I star-forming regions. We measured radial velocities for multiple epochs, obtaining a median precision of 400 ms$^{-1}$. We identified double-lined SB SSTc2d J163154.7-250324 in Ophiuchus, which we determined to be composed of a K7($\pm$0.5) and a K9($\pm$0.5) star, with orbital limits of $a<$0.6 AU and $P<$150 days. This results in an SB fraction of 0.04$^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$ in Ophiuchus, which is consistent with other spectroscopic surveys of non-TD objects in the region. This similarity suggests that TDs are not preferentially sculpted by the presence of close binaries and that planet formation around close binaries may take place over similar timescales to that around single stars.},

	Abstract = {We present key results from the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS): spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and model fits of 330 young stellar objects, predominantly protostars, in the Orion molecular clouds. This is the largest sample of protostars studied in a single, nearby star-formation complex. With near-infrared photometry from 2MASS, mid- and far-infrared data from Spitzer and Herschel, and sub-millimeter photometry from APEX, our SEDs cover 1.2-870 $\mu$m and sample the peak of the protostellar envelope emission at ~100 $\mu$m. Using mid-IR spectral indices and bolometric temperatures, we classify our sample into 92 Class 0 protostars, 125 Class I protostars, 102 flat-spectrum sources, and 11 Class II pre-main-sequence stars. We implement a simple protostellar model (including a disk in an infalling envelope with outflow cavities) to generate a grid of 30400 model SEDs and use it to determine the best-fit model parameters for each protostar. We argue that far-IR data are essential for accurate constraints on protostellar envelope properties. We find that most protostars, and in particular the flat-spectrum sources, are well-fit. The median envelope density and median inclination angle decrease from Class 0 to Class I to flat-spectrum protostars, despite the broad range in best-fit parameters in each of the three categories. We also discuss degeneracies in our model parameters. Our results confirm that the different protostellar classes generally correspond to an evolutionary sequence with a decreasing envelope infall rate, but the inclination angle also plays a role in the appearance, and thus interpretation, of the SEDs.},

	Abstract = {We provide a new view on the Cygnus-X north complex by accessing for the first time the low mass content of young stellar populations in the region. CFHT/WIRCam camera was used to perform a deep near-IR survey of this complex, sampling stellar masses down to ~0.1 M$_\odot$. Several analysis tools, including a extinction treatment developed in this work, were employed to identify and uniformly characterise a dozen unstudied young star clusters in the area. Investigation of their mass distributions in low-mass domain revealed a relatively uniform log-normal IMF with a characteristic mass of 0.32$\pm$0.08 M$_\odot$ and mass dispersion of 0.40$\pm$0.06. In the high mass regime, their derived slopes showed that while the youngest clusters (age < 4 Myr) presented slightly shallower values with respect to the Salpeter's, our older clusters (4 Myr < age < 18 Myr) showed IMF compliant values and a slightly denser stellar population. Although possibly evidencing a deviation from an 'universal' IMF, these results also supports a scenario where these gas dominated young clusters gradually 'build up' their IMF by accreting low-mass stars formed in their vicinity during their first ~3 Myr, before the gas expulsion phase, emerging at the age of ~4 Myr with a fully fledged IMF. Finally, the derived distances to these clusters confirmed the existence of at least 3 different star forming regions throughout Cygnus-X north complex, at distances of 500-900 pc, 1.4-1.7 kpc and 3.0 kpc, and revealed evidence of a possible interaction between some of these stellar populations and the Cygnus-OB2 association.},

	Abstract = {Given that a majority of stars form in multiple systems, in order to fully understand the star- and planet-formation processes we must seek to understand them in multiple stellar systems. With this in mind, we present an analysis of the enigmatic binary T-Tauri system VV Corona Australis, in which both components host discs, but only one is visible at optical wavelengths. We seek to understand the peculiarities of this system by searching for a model for the binary which explains all the available continuum observations of the system. We present new mid-infrared interferometry and near-infrared spectroscopy along with archival millimetre-wave observations, which resolve the binary at 1.3mm for the first time. We compute a grid of pre-main-sequence radiative transfer models and calculate their posterior probabilities given the observed spectral energy distributions and mid-infrared interferometric visibilities of the binary components, beginning with the assumption that the only differences between the two components are their inclination and position angles. Our best-fitting solution corresponds to a relatively low luminosity T-tauri binary, with each component's disc having a large scale height and viewed at moderate inclination ($\sim 50^\circ$), with the infrared companion inclined by $\sim 5^\circ$ degrees more than the primary. Comparing the results of our model to evolutionary models suggests stellar masses $\sim 1.7$M$_\odot$ and an age for the system of 3.5Myr, towards the upper end of previous estimates. Combining these results with accretion indicators from near-IR spectroscopy, we determine an accretion rate of 4.0$\times 10^{-8}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for the primary. We suggest that future observations of VV~CrA and similar systems should prioritise high angular resolution sub-mm and near-IR imaging of the discs and high resolution optical/NIR spectroscopy of the central stars.},

	Abstract = {We present a near-IR survey for the visual multiples in the Orion molecular clouds region at separations between 100 and 1000 AU. These data were acquired at 1.6~$\mu$m with the NICMOS and WFC3 cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope. Additional photometry was obtained for some of the sources at 2.05~$\mu$m with NICMOS and in the $L'$-band with NSFCAM2 on the IRTF. Towards 129 protostars and 197 pre-main sequence stars with disks observed with WFC3, we detect 21 and 28 candidate companions between the projected separations of 100---1000 AU, of which less than 5 and 8, respectively, are chance line of sight coincidences. The resulting companion fraction ($CF$) after the correction for the line of sight contamination is 14.4$^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$% for protostars and 12.5$^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$% for the pre-main sequence stars. These values are similar to those found for main sequence stars, suggesting that there is little variation in the $CF$ with evolution, although several observational biases may mask a decrease in the $CF$ from protostars to the main sequence stars. After segregating the sample into two populations based on the surrounding surface density of YSOs, we find that the $CF$ in the high stellar density regions ($\Sigma_{YSO} > 45$~pc$^{-2}$) is approximately 50% higher than that found in the low stellar density regions ($\Sigma_{YSO} < 45$~pc$^{-2}$). We interpret this as evidence for the elevated formation of companions at 100 to 1000 AU in the denser environments of Orion. We discuss possible reasons for this elevated formation.},

	Abstract = {We present 1.3mm Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations at $\sim$3$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution towards the brightest section of the intermediate/massive star forming cluster NGC 2264-C. The millimetre continuum emission reveals ten 1.3mm continuum peaks, of which four are new detections. The observed frequency range includes the known molecular jet/outflow tracer SiO (5-4), thus providing the first high resolution observations of SiO towards NGC 2264-C. We also detect molecular lines of twelve additional species towards this region, including CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OH, SO, H$_2$CO, DCN, HC$_3$N, and $^{12}$CO. The SiO (5-4) emission reveals the presence of two collimated, high velocity (up to 30kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic velocity) bi-polar outflows in NGC 2264-C. In addition, the outflows are traced by emission from $^{12}$CO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH. We find an evolutionary spread between cores residing in the same parent cloud. The two unambiguous outflows are driven by the brightest mm continuum cores, which are IR-dark, molecular line weak, and likely the youngest cores in the region. Furthermore, towards the RMS source AFGL 989-IRS1, the IR-bright and most evolved source in NGC 2264-C, we observe no molecular outflow emission. A molecular line rich ridge feature, with no obvious directly associated continuum source, lies on the edge of a low density cavity and may be formed from a wind driven by AFGL 989-IRS1. In addition, 229GHz class I maser emission is detected towards this feature.},

This is the first systematic survey of these regions to date. The clusters range in size from several stars to a few hundred stars. Thirty fields ranging in size from 8'×8' to 30'×60' were mapped with 47" resolution simultaneously in the two J=1-0 lines at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory. Seventeen sources were mapped over fields ranging in size from 3'×3' to 13'×13' in the J=2-1 line with 35" resolution at the Submillimeter Telescope Observatory. We compare the cloud properties derived from each of the three tracers in order to better understand systematic uncertainties in determining masses and line widths. Cloud masses are determined independently using the 13CO and C18O transitions; these masses range from 30 to 4000 Msolar. Finally, we present a simple morphological classification scheme, which may serve as a rough indicator of cloud evolution.},

	Abstract = {The magnetic activity of late-type MS stars is characterized by different regimes, and their activity levels are well described by Ro, the ratio between P_rot and the convective turnover time. Very young PMS stars show, similarly to MS stars, intense magnetic activity. However they do not show clear activity-rotation trends, and it still debated which stellar parameters determine their magnetic activity levels. To bridge the gap between MS and PMS stars, we studied the activity-rotation relation in the young cluster h Per, a ~13 Myr old cluster, that contains both fast and slow rotators, whose members have ended their accretion phase and have already developed a radiative core. It offers us the opportunity to study the activity level of intermediate-age PMS stars with different rotational velocities, excluding any interactions with the circumstellar environment. We constrained the magnetic activity levels of h Per members measuring their X-ray emission from a Chandra observation, while P_rot were obtained by Moraux et al. (2013). We collected a final catalog of 414 h Per members with known P_rot, T_eff, M_star, with 169 of them having also detected X-ray emission. We found that h Per members, with 1.0 M_sun < M_star < 1.4 M_sun, display different activity regimes: fast rotators show supersaturation, while slower rotators have activity levels compatible to the non-saturated regime. At 13 Myr h Per is therefore the youngest cluster showing activity-rotation regimes analogous to that of MS stars, indicating that, at this age, magnetic field production is likely regulated by the alpha-Omega type dynamo. Moreover we observed that supersaturation is better described by P_rot than Ro, and that the observed patterns are compatible with the hypothesis of centrifugal stripping. In this scenario we inferred that coronae can produce structures as large as ~2 R_star above the stellar surface.},

	Abstract = {This work is the first attempt to describe the multi-dimensional structure of accreting young stars based on fully compressible time implicit multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. One major motivation is to analyse the validity of accretion treatment used in previous 1D stellar evolution studies. We analyse the effect of accretion on the structure of a realistic stellar model of the young Sun. Our work is inspired by the numerical work of Kley \& Lin (1996, ApJ, 461, 933) devoted to the structure of the boundary layer in accretion disks. We analyse the redistribution of accreted material with a range of values of specific entropy relative to the bulk specific entropy of the material in the accreting object's convective envelope. A primary goal is to understand whether and how accreted energy deposited onto a stellar surface is redistributed in the interior. This study focusses on the high accretion rates characteristic of FU Ori systems. We find that the highest entropy cases produce a distinctive behaviour in the mass redistribution, rms velocities, and enthalpy flux in the convective envelope. This change in behaviour is characterised by the formation of a hot layer on the surface of the accreting object, which tends to suppress convection in the envelope. We analyse the long-term effect of such a hot buffer zone on the structure and evolution of the accreting object with 1D stellar evolution calculations. We study the relevance of the assumption of redistribution of accreted energy into the stellar interior used in the literature. One conclusion is that, for a given amount of accreted energy transferred to the accreting object, a treatment assuming accretion energy redistribution throughout the stellar interior could significantly overestimate the effects on the stellar structure, in particular, on the resulting expansion.},

	Abstract = {We examine the light and color evolution of the T Tauri binary KH 15D through photometry obtained at wavelengths between 0.55 and 8.0 $\mu$m. The data were collected with ANDICAM on the 1.3 m SMARTS telescope at Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory and with IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We show that the system's circumbinary ring, which acts as a screen that covers and uncovers different portions of the binary orbit as the ring precesses, has reached an orientation where the brighter component (star B) fully or nearly fully emerges during each orbital cycle. The fainter component (star A) remains fully occulted by the screen at all phases. The leading and trailing edges of the screen move across the sky at the same rate of $\sim$15 meters per second, consistent with expectation for a ring with a radius and width of $\sim$4 AU and a precession period of $\sim$6500 years. Light and color variations continue to indicate that the screen is sharp edged and opaque at \emph{VRIJH} wavelengths. However, we find an increasing transparency of the ring edge at 2.2, 3.6, and 4.5 $\mu$m. Reddening seen at the beginning of the eclipse that occurred during the CSI 2264 campaign particularly suggests selective extinction by a population of large dust grains. Meanwhile, the gradual bluing observed while star B is setting is indicative of forward scattering effects at the edge of the ring. The SED of the system at its bright phase shows no evidence of infrared excess emission that can be attributed to radiation from the ring or other dust component out to 8 microns.},

	Abstract = {Young solar-type stars grow through the accretion of material from the circumstellar disk during pre-main sequence (PMS) evolution. The ultraviolet radiation generated in this process plays a key role in the chemistry and evolution of young planetary disks. In particular, the hydrogen Lyman-alpha line (Lya) etches the disk surface by driving photoevaporative flows that control disk evolution. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, we have monitored the PMS binary star AK Sco during the periastron passage and have detected a drop of the H2 flux by up to 10% lasting 5.9 hours. We show that the decrease of the H2 flux can be produced by the occultation of the stellar Lya photons by a gas stream in free fall from 3 R*. Given the high optical depth of the Lya line, a very low gas column of NH > 5e17 cm-2 suffices to block the Lya radiation without producing noticeable effects in the rest of the stellar spectral tracers.},

	Abstract = {V1184 Tau is a young variable for long time monitored at optical wavelengths. Its variability has been ascribed to a sudden and repetitive increase of the circumstellar extinction (UXor-type variable), but the physical origin of such variation, although hypothesized, has not been fully supported on observational basis. To get a new insight into the variability of V1184 Tau, we present new photometric and spectroscopic observations taken in the period 2008-2015. During these years the source has reached the same high brightness level that had before the remarkable fading of about 5 mag undergone in 2004. The optical spectrum is the first obtained when the continuum is at its maximum level. The observations are interpreted in the framework of extinction driven variability. We analyze light curves, optical and near-infrared colors, SED and optical spectrum. The emerging picture indicates that the source fading is due to an extinction increase of DeltaA_V about 5 mag, associated with a strong infrared excess, attributable to a thermal component at T=1000 K. From the flux of H(alpha) we derive a mass accretion rate between 10^-11 -5 10^-10 M_sun yr^-1 s, consistent with that of classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. The source SED was fitted for both the high and low level of brightness. A scenario consistent with the known stellar properties (such as spectral type, mass and radius) is obtained only if the distance to the source is of few hundreds of parsecs, in contrast with the commonly assumed value of 1.5 kpc. Our analysis partially supports that presented by Grinin (2009), according to which the circumstellar disk undergoes a periodical puffing, whose observational effects are both to shield the central star and to evidence a disk wind activity. However, since the mass accretion rate remains almost constant with time, the source is likely not subject to accretion bursts.},

	Abstract = {The authors study the behavior of slow changes in solar irradiance, S, using measurements obtained with radiometers on the SMM and Nimbus 7 spacecraft. The analysis of the 1978 - 1984 ACRIM and ERB radiometry reveals low-amplitude (0.04% - 0.07%) variations in S on time scales of 4 - 9 months that are well correlated between these two data bases. The variations correlate very well with changes in facular radiations. It is also shown that the slow downtrend in S seen since 1981 by the ACRIM and ERB arises mainly from a decreasing irradiance contribution of bright photospheric magnetic elements outside the large faculae included in the daily CaK plage index. The finding that this network contribution is unbalanced over several years shows that photospheric activity has a net influence on solar luminosity, besides the more nearly balanced contributions of the spots and the large faculae.},

	Abstract = {Long-term variations in the solar total irradiance found in the ACRIM I experiment on the SMM satellite have revealed a downward trend during the declining phase of solar cycle 21 of the sunspot cycle, a flat period between mid-1095 and mid-1987, and an upturn in late 1987 which suggests a direct correlation of luminosity and solar active region population. If the upturn continues into the activity maximum of solar cycle 22, a relation between solar activity and luminosity of possible climatological significance could be ascertained. The best-fit relationship for the variation of total irradiance S with sunspot number Rz and 10-cm flux F(10) are S = 1366.82 + 7.71 x 10 to the -3rd Rz and S = 1366.27 + 8.98 x 10 to the -3rd F(10)(W/sq m).

	Abstract = {We examine patterns of variation of 32 primarily main-sequence Sun-like stars [selected at project onset as stars on or near the main sequence and color index 0.42<=(B-V)<=1.4], extending our previous 7-12 yr time series to 13-20 yr by combining Str{\"o}mgren b, y photometry from Lowell Observatory with similar data from Fairborn Observatory. Parallel chromospheric Ca II H and K emission data from the Mount Wilson Observatory span the entire interval. The extended data strengthen the relationship between chromospheric and brightness variability at visible wavelengths derived previously. We show that the full range of photometric variation has probably now been observed for a majority of the program stars. Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable according to an objective statistical criterion. On a year-to-year timescale, young active stars become fainter when their Ca II emission increases, while older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca II emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y stellar filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample.},

	Abstract = {We image with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity disk features that could be potential signs of planet-disk interaction. Two companion candidates have been claimed in the disk around the young Herbig Ae/Be star HD100546. Thus, this object serves as an excellent target for our investigation of the natal environment of giant planets. We exploit the power of extreme adaptive optics operating in conjunction with the new high-contrast imager SPHERE to image HD100546 in scattered light. We obtain the first polarized light observations of this source in the visible (with resolution as fine as 2 AU) and new H and K band total intensity images that we analyze with the Pynpoint package. The disk shows a complex azimuthal morphology, where multiple scattering of photons most likely plays an important role. High brightness contrasts and arm-like structures are ubiquitous in the disk. A double-wing structure (partly due to ADI processing) resembles a morphology newly observed in inclined disks. Given the cavity size in the visible (11 AU), the CO emission associated to the planet candidate 'c' might arise from within the circumstellar disk. We find an extended emission in the K band at the expected location of 'b'. The surrounding large-scale region is the brightest in scattered light. There is no sign of any disk gap associated to 'b'.},

	Abstract = {We present Herschel/HIFI observations (WISH KP) of 14 water lines in a small sample of galactic massive protostellar objects: NGC6334I(N), DR21(OH), IRAS16272-4837, and IRAS05358+3543. We analyze the gas dynamics from the line profiles. Through modeling of the observations using RATRAN, we estimate outflow, infall, turbulent velocities, molecular abundances, and investigate any correlation with the evolutionary status of each source. The molecular line profiles exhibit a broad component coming from the shocks along the cavity walls associated with the protostars, and an infalling (or expansion for IRAS05358+3543) and passively heated envelope component, with highly supersonic turbulence likely increasing with the distance from the center. Accretion rates between 6.3 10^{-5} and 5.6 10^{-4} \msun yr^{-1} are derived from the infall observed in three of our sources. The outer water abundance is estimated to be at the typical value of a few 10^{-8} while the inner abundance varies from 1.7 10^{-6} to 1.4 10^{-4} with respect to H2 depending on the source. We confirm that regions of massive star formation are highly turbulent and that the turbulence likely increases in the envelope with the distance to the star. The inner abundances are lower than the expected 10^{-4} perhaps because our observed lines do not probe deep enough into the inner envelope, or because photodissociation through protostellar UV photons is more efficient than expected. We show that the higher the infall/expansion velocity in the protostellar envelope, the higher is the inner abundance, maybe indicating that larger infall/expansion velocities generate shocks that will sputter water from the ice mantles of dust grains in the inner region. High-velocity water must be formed in the gas-phase from shocked material.},

@article{cze16a,
	Abstract = {We present new ALMA observations of CO $J$=2$-$1 line emission from the DQ Tau circumbinary disk. These data are used to tomographically reconstruct the Keplerian disk velocity field in a forward-modeling inference framework, and thereby provide a dynamical constraint on the mass of the DQ Tau binary of $M_\ast = 1.27_{-0.27}^{+0.46} \,M_\odot$. Those results are compared with an updated and improved orbital solution for this double-lined system based on long-term monitoring of its stellar radial velocities. Both of these independent dynamical constraints on the binary mass are in excellent agreement: taken together, they demonstrate that the DQ Tau system mass is $1.21\pm0.26\,M_\odot$ and that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned within $3^\circ$ (at 3$\sigma$ confidence). The predictions of various theoretical models for pre-main sequence stellar evolution are also consistent with these masses, although more detailed comparisons are difficult due to lingering uncertainties in the photospheric properties of the individual components. DQ Tau is the third nearly equal-mass double-lined spectroscopic binary with a circumbinary disk that has been dynamically "weighed" with these two independent techniques: all show consistent results, validating the overall accuracy of the disk-based approach and demonstrating that it can be robustly applied to large samples of young, single stars as ALMA ramps up to operations at full capacity.},

@article{sta16a,
	Abstract = {We provide CoRoT and Spitzer light curves, as well as broad-band multi-wavelength photometry and high resolution, multi- and single-epoch spectroscopy for 17 classical T Tauris in NGC 2264 whose CoRoT light curves (LCs) exemplify the "stochastic" LC class as defined in Cody et al. (2014). The most probable physical mechanism to explain the optical variability in this LC class is time-dependent mass accretion onto the stellar photosphere, producing transient hot spots. As evidence in favor of this hypothesis, multi-epoch high resolution spectra for a subset of these stars shows that their veiling levels also vary in time and that this veiling variability is consistent in both amplitude and timescale with the optical LC morphology. Furthermore, the veiling variability is well-correlated with the strength of the HeI 6678A emission line, a feature predicted by models to arise in accretion shocks on or near the stellar photosphere. Stars with accretion burst LC morphology (Stauffer et al. 2014) are also attributed to variable mass accretion. Both the stochastic and accretion burst LCs can be explained by a simple model of randomly occurring flux bursts, with the stochastic LC class having a higher frequency of lower amplitude events. Based on their UV excesses, veiling, and mean Ha equivalent widths, members of the stochastic LC class have only moderate time-averaged mass accretion rates. The most common feature of their Ha profiles is for them to exhibit blue-shifted absorption features, most likely originating in a disk wind. The lack of periodic signatures in the LCs suggests that little of the variability is due to long-lived hot spots rotating into or out of our line of sight; instead, the primary driver of the observed photometric variability is likely to be instabilities in the inner disk that lead to variable mass accretion.},

	Abstract = {Depending on whether a T Tauri star accretes material from its circumstellar disk or not, different X-ray emission properties can be found. The accretion shocks produce cool heating of the plasma, contributing to the soft X-ray emission from the star. Using X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep Project and accretion rates that were obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 photometric measurements in the Orion Nebula Cluster, we studied the relation between the accretion processes and the X-ray emissions of a coherent sample of T Tauri sources in the region. We performed regression and correlation analyses of our sample of T Tauri stars between the X-ray parameters, stellar properties, and the accretion measurements. We find that a clear anti-correlation is present between the residual X-ray luminosity and the accretion rates in our samples in Orion that is consistent with that found on the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus molecular cloud (XEST) study. We provide a catalog with X-ray luminosities (corrected from distance) and accretion measurements of an Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) T Tauri stars sample. Although Orion and Taurus display strong differences in their properties (total gas and dust mass, star density, strong irradiation from massive stars), we find that a similar relation between the residual X-ray emission and accretion rate is present in the Taurus molecular cloud and in the accreting samples from the Orion Nebula Cluster. The spread in the data suggests dependencies of the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities other than the stellar mass, but the similarity between Orion and Taurus hints at the environment not being one of them. The anti-correlation between the residual X-ray luminosity and mass accretion rate is inherent to the T Tauri stars in general, independent of their birthplace and environment, and intrinsic to early stellar evolution.},

	Abstract = {Protoplanetary disks dissipate rapidly after the central star forms, on time-scales comparable to those inferred for planet formation. In order to allow the formation of planets, disks must survive the dispersive effects of UV and X-ray photoevaporation for at least a few Myr. Viscous accretion depletes significant amounts of the mass in gas and solids, while photoevaporative flows driven by internal and external irradiation remove most of the gas. A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets. Here, we review our current understanding of disk evolution and dispersal, and discuss how these might affect planet formation. We also discuss existing observational constraints on dispersal mechanisms and future directions.},

	Abstract = {We report high-resolution observations at mid-infrared wavelengths of a minor solar flare, SOL2014-09-24T17T17:50 (C7.0), using Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) cameras at an auxiliary of the McMath-Pierce telescope. The flare emissions, the first simultaneous observations in two mid-infrared bands at $5\ \mu$m and $8\ \mu$m with white-light and hard X-ray coverage, revealed impulsive time variability with increases on time scales of $\sim 4$~s followed by exponential decay at $\sim$10 s in two bright regions separated by about 13$"$. The brightest source is compact, unresolved spatially at the diffraction limit ($1.3"$ at $5\ \mu$m). We identify the IR sources as flare ribbons also seen in white-light emission at 6173~\AA~observed by SDO/HMI, with twin hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI, and with EUV sources (e.g., 94~\AA) observed by SDO/AIA. The two infrared points have closely the same flux density ($f_\nu$, W/m$^2$Hz) and extrapolate to a level about an order of magnitude below that observed in the visible band by HMI, but with a flux more than two orders of magnitude above the free-free continuum from the hot ($\sim$15 MK) coronal flare loop observed in the X-ray range. The observations suggest that the IR emission is optically thin, this constraint and others suggest major contributions from a density less than about $3 \times 10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. We tentatively interpret this emission mechanism as predominantly free-free emission in a highly ionized but cool and rather dense chromospheric region.},

	Abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are strongly irradiated by a stellar FUV spectrum that is dominated by Ly$\alpha$ photons. We investigate the impact of stellar Ly$\alpha$ irradiation on the terrestrial planet region of disks ($\lesssim 1$AU) using an updated thermal-chemical model of a disk atmosphere irradiated by stellar FUV and X-rays. The radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ is implemented in a simple approach that includes scattering by H I and absorption by molecules and dust. Because of their non-radial propagation path, scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons deposit their energy deeper in the disk atmosphere than the radially propagating FUV continuum photons. We find that Ly$\alpha$ has a significant impact on the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Photochemical heating produced by scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with water vapor and OH leads to a layer of hot (1500 - 2500 K) molecular gas. The temperature in the layer is high enough to thermally excite the H$_2$ to vibrational levels from which they can be fluoresced by Ly$\alpha$ to produce UV fluorescent H$_2$ emission. The resulting atmospheric structure may help explain the origin of UV fluorescent H$_2$ that is commonly observed from classical T Tauri stars.},

@article{rod15a,
	Abstract = {We present photometric observations of RW Aurigae, a Classical T Tauri system, that reveal two remarkable dimming events. These events are similar to that which we observed in 2010-2011, which was the first such deep dimming observed in RW Aur in a century's worth of photometric monitoring. We suggested the 2010-2011 dimming was the result of an occultation of the star by its tidally disrupted circumstellar disk. In 2012-2013, the RW Aur system dimmed by ~0.7 mag for ~40 days and in 2014/2015 the system dimmed by ~2 mag for >250 days. The ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agree well with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that the new dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source. Therefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events, measured using data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope and the Kutztown University Observatory, are also occultations of RW Aur A by tidally disrupted circumstellar material. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the eccentric fly-by of RW Aur B suggest the occulting body to be a bridge of material connecting RW Aur A and B. These simulations suggest the possibility of additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in this work. The color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally stripped disk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at the leading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebbles producing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material. It is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building prior to the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as a result of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests the presence of advanced planet building material in the space between RW Aur A and B.},

	Abstract = {A major impediment to understanding star formation in massive star-forming regions (MSFRs) is the absence of a reliable stellar chronometer to unravel their complex star formation histories. We present a new estimation of stellar ages using a new method that employs near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray photometry, Age JX . Stellar masses are derived from X-ray luminosities using the LX -M relation from the Taurus cloud. J-band luminosities are compared to mass-dependent pre-main-sequence (PMS) evolutionary models to estimate ages. Age JX is sensitive to a wide range of evolutionary stages, from disk-bearing stars embedded in a cloud to widely dispersed older PMS stars. The Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-ray (MYStIX) project characterizes 20 OB-dominated MSFRs using X-ray, mid-infrared, and NIR catalogs. The Age JX method has been applied to 5525 out of 31,784 MYStIX Probable Complex Members. We provide a homogeneous set of median ages for over 100 subclusters in 15 MSFRs; median subcluster ages range between 0.5 Myr and 5 Myr. The important science result is the discovery of age gradients across MYStIX regions. The wide MSFR age distribution appears as spatially segregated structures with different ages. The Age JX ages are youngest in obscured locations in molecular clouds, intermediate in revealed stellar clusters, and oldest in distributed populations. The NIR color index J - H, a surrogate measure of extinction, can serve as an approximate age predictor for young embedded clusters.},

	Abstract = {The lack of observed transition discs with inner gas holes of radii greater than ~50AU implies that protoplanetary discs dispersed from the inside out must remove gas from the outer regions rapidly. We investigate the role of photoevaporation in the final clearing of gas from low mass discs with inner holes. In particular, we study the so-called "thermal sweeping" mechanism which results in rapid clearing of the disc. Thermal sweeping was originally thought to arise when the radial and vertical pressure scale lengths at the X-ray heated inner edge of the disc match. We demonstrate that this criterion is not fundamental. Rather, thermal sweeping occurs when the pressure maximum at the inner edge of the dust heated disc falls below the maximum possible pressure of X-ray heated gas (which depends on the local X-ray flux). We derive new critical peak volume and surface density estimates for rapid radiative clearing which, in general, result in rapid dispersal happening less readily than in previous estimates. This less efficient clearing of discs by X-ray driven thermal sweeping leaves open the issue of what mechanism can clear gas from the outer disc sufficiently quickly to explain the non-detection of cold gas around weak line T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We present Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) adaptive optics near-infrared images of the giant planet-forming regions of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby (D = 54 pc), pre-main sequence (classical T Tauri) star TW Hydrae. The GPI images, which were obtained in coronagraphic/polarimetric mode, exploit starlight scattered off small dust grains to elucidate the surface density structure of the TW Hya disk from 80 AU to within 10 AU of the star at 1.5 AU resolution. The GPI polarized intensity images unambiguously con?rm the presence of a gap in the radial surface brightness distribution of the inner disk. The gap is centered near 23 AU, with a width of 5 AU and a depth of 50%. In the context of recent simulations of giant planet formation in gaseous, dusty disks orbiting pre-main sequence stars, these results indicate that at least one young planet with a mass 0.2 M_J could be present in the TW Hya disk at an orbital semi-major axis similar to that of Uranus. If this (proto)planet is actively accreting gas from the disk, it may be readily detectable by GPI or a similarly sensitive, high-resolution infrared imaging system.},

	Abstract = {X-ray observations of pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars of M-type probe coronal emission and offer a means to investigate magnetic activity at the stellar-substellar boundary. Recent observations of main sequence (MS) stars at this boundary display a decrease in fractional X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}$/$L_{bol}$) by almost two orders of magnitude for spectral types M7 and later. We investigate magnetic activity and search for a decrease in X-ray emission in the pre-MS progenitors of these MS stars. We present XMM-Newton X-ray observations and preliminary results for ~10 nearby (30-70 pc), very low mass pre-MS stars in the relatively unexplored age range of 10-30 Myr. We compare the fractional X-ray luminosities of these 10-30 Myr old stars to younger (1-3 Myr) pre-MS brown dwarfs and find no dependence on spectral type or age suggesting that X-ray activity declines at an age later than ~30 Myr in these very low-mass stars.},

@article{ken95a,
	Abstract = {This paper analyzes optical and infrared photometry of pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. More than half of the stars in our sample have excess near-infrared emission. The near-infrared excesses correlate very well with other measures of activity, such as Ho emission, ultraviolet excess emission, millimeter continuum emission, and the presence of reflection nebulae and molecular outflows. The infrared colors and the ratio of far-infrared to bolometric luminosity display a smooth progression from the most deeply embedded protostars to optically visible T Tauri stars. Infalling envelope models account for the colors of protostars; simple disk models similarly reproduce the colors of many T Tauri stars.  Both the stellar birth line and a l05 yr isochrone provide a reasonable upper envelope to the luminosity distribution of optically visible stars in the H-R diagram. Only a few stars in the cloud have apparent ages exceeding 2- 3 × 106 yr, as derived from detailed stellar evolution calculations. The distribution of stars in the H-R diagram indicates that the cloud has formed stars at a roughly constant rate for the past 1-2 × 106 yr. Analyses of the J and K-luminosity functions support this conclusion. Within the uncertainties, the observed mass distribution for optically visible stars agrees with a Miller-Scalo initial mass function. Source statistics imply a lifetime of 1-2 × l05 yr for the typical protostar in Taurus-Auriga. There is no evidence, however, that these sources lie on the stellar birth line. Indeed, the protostellar luminosity function is essentially identical to the luminosity function derived for optically visible T Tauri stars in the cloud.  These results provide some support for the evolutionary sequence-embedded protostar --> T Tauri star with a circumstellar disk --> T Tauri star without a circumstellar disk-currently envisioned in standard models of low-mass star formation. Source statistics and infrared color-color diagrams demonstrate that pre-main-sequence stars develop bluer colors and display less evidence for circumstellar material with time. The data show little evidence, however, for the luminosity evolution expected along the proposed evolutionary sequence. Time-dependent accretion during the infall phase may account for the low luminosity of Taurus-Auriga protostars; this hypothesis requires more tests.},

It starts with a brief overview of the star formation process and highlights the open questions from an observational point of view. These are found at the smallest scales, as this is, inevitably, where all the action such as accretion and outflows, occurs. We then use basic astrophysical concepts to assess which scales and conditions can be probed with existing interferometric set-ups for which we use the ESO/VLTI instrument suite as example. We will concentrate on the more massive stars observed at high resolution with continuum interferometry. Throughout, some of the most recent interferometric results are used as examples of the various processes discussed.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that stellar companions can influence the evolution of a protoplanetary disk. Nevertheless, previous disk surveys did not - and could not - consistently exclude binaries from their samples. We present a study dedicated to investigating the frequency of ongoing disk accretion around single stars in a star-forming region. We obtained near-infrared spectroscopy of 54 low-mass stars selected from a high-angular resolution survey in the 2-3 Myr-old Chamaeleon I region to determine the presence of Brackett-$\gamma$ emission, taking the residual chance of undetected multiplicity into account, which we estimate to be on the order of 30%. The result is compared with previous surveys of the same feature in binary stars of the same region to provide a robust estimate of the difference between the accretor fractions of single stars and individual components of binary systems. We find Br$\gamma$ emission among $39.5^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$% of single stars, which is a significantly higher fraction than for binary stars in Chamaeleon I. In particular, close binary systems with separations <100 AU show emission in only $6.5^{+16.5}_{-3.0}$% of the cases according to the same analysis. The emitter frequency of wider binaries appears consistent with the single star value. Interpreting Br$\gamma$ emission as a sign of ongoing accretion and correcting for sensitivity bias, we infer an accretor fraction of single stars of F_acc=$47.8^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$%. This is slightly higher but consistent with previous estimates that do not clearly exclude binaries from their samples. Through our robust and consistent analysis, we confirm that the fraction of young single stars harboring accretion disks is much larger than that of close binaries at the same age. Our findings have important implications for the timescales of disk evolution and planet formation.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus, both to inform studies of "normal" main-sequence stars and enable robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a sample of ~600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the position and width of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus as a function of g - i color, and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral typing pipeline, described in the Appendix to this paper. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished on the basis of their J - Ks and r - z colors. We also identify a group of objects with correlated offsets in the u - g versus g - r and g - r versus r - i color-color spaces, but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects. Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas of color-magnitude space.},

	Abstract = {The Cygnus-X star-forming complex is one of the most active regions of low- and high-mass star formation within 2 kpc of the Sun. Using mid-infrared photometry from the IRAC and MIPS Spitzer Cygnus-X Legacy Survey, we have identified over 1800 protostar candidates. We compare the protostellar luminosity functions of two regions within Cygnus-X: CygX-South and CygX-North. These two clouds show distinctly different morphologies suggestive of dissimilar star-forming environments. We find the luminosity functions of these two regions are statistically different. Furthermore, we compare the luminosity functions of protostars found in regions of high and low stellar density within Cygnus-X and find that the luminosity function in regions of high stellar density is biased to higher luminosities. In total, these observations provide further evidence that the luminosities of protostars depend on their natal environment. We discuss the implications this dependence has for the star formation process.},

	Abstract = {We present new images and photometry of the massive star-forming complex Cygnus X obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. A combination of IRAC, MIPS, UKIRT Deep Infrared Sky Survey, and Two Micron All Sky Survey data are used to identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs). Of the 8231 sources detected exhibiting infrared excess in Cygnus X North, 670 are classified as class I and 7249 are classified as class II. Using spectra from the FAST Spectrograph at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory and Hectospec on the MMT, we spectrally typed 536 sources in the Cygnus X complex to identify the massive stars. We find that YSOs tend to be grouped in the neighborhoods of massive B stars (spectral types B0 to B9). We present a minimal spanning tree analysis of clusters in two regions in Cygnus X North. The fraction of infrared excess sources that belong to clusters with >=10 members is found to be 50%-70%. Most class II objects lie in dense clusters within blown out H II regions, while class I sources tend to reside in more filamentary structures along the bright-rimmed clouds, indicating possible triggered star formation.},

	Abstract = {Young stars are surrounded by copious amounts of circumstellar material. Its composition, in particular its gas-to-dust ratio, is an important parameter. However, measuring this ratio is challenging, because gas mass estimates are often model dependent. X-ray absorption is sensitive to the gas along the line-of-sight while optical/near-IR extinction depends on the dust content. Therefore, the gas-to-dust ratio of an absorber is given by the ratio between X-ray and optical/near-IR extinction. We present three systems where we used X-ray and optical/near-IR data to constrain the gas-to-dust ratio of circumstellar material; from a dust-rich debris disk to gaseous protoplanetary disks.},

	Abstract = {We present the fiducial main-sequence stellar locus traced by 10 photometric colours observed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Median colours are determined using 1052 793 stars with r-band extinction less than 0.125. We use this locus to measure the dust extinction curve relative to the r band, which is consistent with previous measurements in the SDSS and 2MASS bands. The WISE band extinction coefficients are larger than predicted by standard extinction models. Using 13 lines of sight, we find variations in the extinction curve in H, Ks, and WISE bandpasses. Relative extinction decreases towards Galactic anticentre, in agreement with prior studies. Relative extinction increases with Galactic latitude, in contrast to previous observations. This indicates a universal mid-IR extinction law does not exist due to variations in dust grain size and chemistry with Galactocentric position. A preliminary search for outliers due to warm circumstellar dust is also presented, using stars with high signal-to-noise ratio in the W3 band. We find 199 such outliers, identified by excess emission in Ks - W3. Inspection of SDSS images for these outliers reveals a large number of contaminants due to nearby galaxies. Six sources appear to be genuine dust candidates, yielding a fraction of systems with infrared excess of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.05 per cent.},

The X-ray data show that the absorbing column density increased from $N_H<0.1\times10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ during the bright state to $\approx2\times10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ in the dim state. The brightness ratio between dim and bright state at optical to NIR wavelengths shows only a moderate wavelength dependence and the NIR color-color diagram suggests no substantial reddening. Taken together, this indicates gray absorption by large grains ($\gtrsim1\,\mu$m) with a dust mass column density of $\gtrsim2\times10^{-4}\,$g$\,$cm$^{-2}$. Comparison with $N_H$ shows that an absorber responsible for the optical/NIR dimming and the X-ray absorption is compatible with the ISM's gas-to-dust ratio, i.e., that grains grow in the disk surface layers without largely altering the gas-to-dust ratio. Lastly, we discuss a scenario in which a common mechanism can explain the long-lasting dimming in RW Aur and recently in AA Tau.},

@article{ans15a,
	Abstract = {We present ten young ($\lesssim$10 Myr) late-K and M dwarf stars observed in K2 Campaign 2 that host protoplanetary disks and exhibit quasi-periodic or aperiodic dimming events. Their optical light curves show $\sim$10-20 dips in flux over the 80-day observing campaign with durations of $\sim$0.5-2 days and depths of up to $\sim$40%. These stars are all members of the $\rho$ Ophiuchus ($\sim$1 Myr) or Upper Scorpius ($\sim$10 Myr) star-forming regions. To investigate the nature of these "dippers" we obtained: optical and near-infrared spectra to determine stellar properties and identify accretion signatures; adaptive optics imaging to search for close companions that could cause optical variations and/or influence disk evolution; and millimeter-wavelength observations to constrain disk dust and gas masses. The spectra reveal Li I absorption and H$\alpha$ emission consistent with stellar youth (<50 Myr), but also accretion rates spanning those of classical and weak-line T Tauri stars. Infrared excesses are consistent with protoplanetary disks extending to within $\sim$10 stellar radii in most cases; however, the sub-mm observations imply disk masses that are an order of magnitude below those of typical protoplanetary disks. We find a positive correlation between dip depth and WISE-2 excess, which we interpret as evidence that the dipper phenomenon is related to occulting structures in the inner disk, although this is difficult to reconcile with the weakly accreting aperiodic dippers. We consider three mechanisms to explain the dipper phenomenon: inner disk warps near the co-rotation radius related to accretion; vortices at the inner disk edge produced by the Rossby Wave Instability; and clumps of circumstellar material related to planetesimal formation.},

@article{fri15a,
	Abstract = {(abridged) Context: Both observations and simulations of embedded protostars have progressed rapidly in recent years. Bringing them together is an important step in advancing our knowledge about the earliest phases of star formation. Aims: To compare synthetic continuum images and SEDs, created from large-scale numerical simulations, to observational studies - thereby aiding both in the interpretation of observations and test the fidelity of the simulations. Methods: The radiative transfer code RADMC-3D is used to create synthetic continuum images and SEDs of protostellar systems in a large numerical simulation of a molecular cloud. More than 13000 unique radiative transfer models are produced of a variety of different protostellar systems. Results: Over the course of 0.76 Myr more than 500 protostars are formed in the simulation - primarily within two sub-clusters. Synthetic SEDs are used to calculate evolutionary tracers Tbol and Lsmm/Lbol. It is shown that, while the observed distributions of tracers are well matched by the simulation, they generally do a poor job of tracking the protostellar ages. Disks form early in the simulation, with 40 % of Class 0 objects containing one. The flux emission from the simulated disks is found to be approximately a factor of 6 too low when comparing to real observations; an issue that can be traced back to numerical effects on the smallest scales in the simulation. The luminosity distribution of the protostars in the simulation spans three order of magnitudes similar to the observed distribution. Cores and protostars are found to be closely associated with one-another, with the distance distribution between them being in excellent agreement with observations. Conclusions: The analysis and statistical comparison of synthetic observations to real ones is established as a powerful tool in the interpretation of observational results.},

	Abstract = {We present the analysis of 34 new VLT/X-Shooter spectra of young stellar objects in the Chamaeleon I star forming region, together with four more spectra of stars in Taurus and two in Chamaeleon II. The broad wavelength coverage and accurate flux calibration of our spectra allow us to estimate stellar and accretion parameters for our targets by fitting the photospheric and accretion continuum emission from the Balmer continuum down to 700 nm. The dependence of accretion with stellar properties for this sample is consistent with previous results from the literature. The accretion rates for transitional disks are consistent with those of full disks in the same region. The spread of mass accretion rates at any given stellar mass is found to be smaller than in many studies, but is larger than that derived in the Lupus clouds using similar data and techniques. Differences in the stellar mass range and in the environmental conditions between our sample and that of Lupus may account for the discrepancy in scatter between Chamaeleon I and Lupus. Complete samples in Chamaeleon I and Lupus are needed to determine whether the difference in scatter of accretion rates and the lack of evolutionary trends are robust to sample selection.},

@article{piz15a,
	Abstract = {X-ray emission from Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is crucial to understand star formation. A very limited amount of X-ray results is available for the protostellar (ClassI) phase. A systematic search of transient X-ray phenomena combined with a careful evaluation of the evolutionary stage offer a widely unexplored window to our understanding of YSOs X-ray properties. Within the EXTraS project, a search for transients and variability in the whole XMM-Newton archive, we discover transient X-ray emission consistent with ISO-Oph 85, a strongly embedded YSO in the rho Ophiuchi region, not detected in previous time-averaged X-ray studies. We extract an X-ray light curve for the flare and determine its spectral parameters from XMM-Newton/EPIC (European Photon Imaging Camera) data using quantile analysis. The X-ray flare ($2500\,s$), the only one detected in the XMM-Newton archive for ISO-Oph 85, has a luminosity of $LogL_X[erg/s]=31.1$ and a spectrum consistent with a highly-absorbed one-component thermal model ($N_H=1.0^{+1.2}_{-0.5}10^{23}\,cm^{-2}$, $kT=1.15^{+2.35}_{-0.65}\,keV)$. We set an upper limit of $LogL_X[erg/s]<29.5$ to the quiescent X-ray luminosity. We build a SED with IR to mm photometry drawn from literature and mid-IR Spitzer and sub-mm Herschel photometry analysed by us, and compare it with pre-computed models. The sub-mm emission peak in the Herschel data suggests that the object is a ClassI protostar. However, the Herschel/IR position offset is larger than for other YSOs in the region, leaving some doubt on the association. This is the first X-ray flare from a YSO recognised as a candidate ClassI YSO via the analysis of its complete SED. This work shows how the analysis of the whole SED is fundamental for the classification of YSOs, and how the X-ray source detection techniques we developed can open a new era in time-resolved analysis of the X-ray emission from stars.},

	Abstract = {The Cygnus OB2 Association is one of the nearest and largest collections of massive stars in the Galaxy. Situated at the heart of the ``Cygnus X'' complex of star-forming regions and molecular clouds, its distance has proven elusive owing to the ambiguous nature of kinematic distances along this l ~= 80$\,^{\circ}$ sightline and the heavy, patchy extinction. In an effort to refine the three-dimensional geometry of key Cygnus X constituents, we have measured distances to four eclipsing double-lined OB-type spectroscopic binaries that are probable members of Cyg OB2. We find distances of 1.33 $\pm$ 0.17, 1.32 $\pm$ 0.07, 1.44 $\pm$ 0.18, and 1.32 $\pm$ 0.13 kpc toward MT91 372, MT91 696, CPR2002 A36, and Schulte 3, respectively. We adopt a weighted average distance of 1.33 $\pm$ 0.06 kpc. This agrees well with spectrophotometric estimates for the Association as a whole and with parallax measurements of protostellar masers in the surrounding interstellar clouds, thereby linking the ongoing star formation in these clouds with Cyg OB2. We also identify Schulte 3C (O9.5V), a 4" visual companion to the 4.75 day binary Schulte 3(A+B), as a previously unrecognized Association member.},

	Abstract = {The \textit{Spitzer} SAGE survey has allowed the identification and analysis of significant samples of Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). However the angular resolution of \textit{Spitzer} is relatively poor meaning that at the distance of the LMC, it is likely that many of the \textit{Spitzer} YSO candidates in fact contain multiple components. We present high resolution \textit{K}-band integral field spectroscopic observations of the three most prominent massive YSO candidates in the N113 H\,{\sc ii} region using VLT/SINFONI. We have identified six \textit{K}-band continuum sources within the three \textit{Spitzer} sources and we have mapped the morphology and velocity fields of extended line emission around these sources. Br$\gamma$, He\,{\sc i} and H$_2$ emission is found at the position of all six \textit{K}-band sources; we discuss whether the emission is associated with the continuum sources or whether it is ambient emission. H$_2$ emission appears to be mostly ambient emission and no evidence of CO emission arising in the discs of YSOs has been found. We have mapped the centroid velocities of extended Br$\gamma$ emission and He {\sc i} emission and found evidence of two expanding compact H\,{\sc ii} regions. One source shows compact and strong H$_2$ emission suggestive of a molecular outflow. The diversity of spectroscopic properties observed is interpreted in the context of a range of evolutionary stages associated with massive star formation.},

	Abstract = {The Cygnus OB2 association is the largest concentration of young and massive stars within 2 kpc of the Sun, including an estimated 65 O-type stars and hundreds of OB stars. The Chandra Cygnus OB2 Legacy Survey is a large imaging program undertaken with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The survey has imaged the central 0.5 deg^2 of the Cyg OB2 association with an effective exposure of 120ks and an outer 0.35 deg^2 area with an exposure of 60ks. Here we describe the survey design and observations, the data reduction and source detection, and present a catalog of 8,000 X-ray point sources. The survey design employs a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointings, a method that overcomes Chandra's low off-axis sensitivity and produces a highly uniform exposure over the inner 0.5 deg^2. The full X-ray catalog is described here and is made available online.},

	Abstract = {The correlation between observed stellar X-ray luminosities, bolometric luminosities, and projected rotational velocities for stars of various spectral types and luminosity classes are determined. Early type stars (O3 to A5) have X-ray luminosities independent of rotational velocities, and correlating with bolometric luminosities. Late type stars of spectral type G to M have luminosities well correlated to equatorial rotational velocities, and are independent of luminosity class. The dependence of late type stars is found to be equivalent to a relation between the X-ray surface flux and the stellar angular velocity. F stars are intermediate with X-ray luminosities higher than would be predicted on the basis of the early type star relation, although lower than expected from the late type velocity dependence. The location of RS CVn stars as a class is also discussed, and it is found that the heating of late type stellar coronas does not result from direct conversion of ratational energy.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of narrow of NaI and KI absorption resonance lines toward nearly 40 T Tauri stars in Taurus with the goal of clarifying their origin. The NaI 5889.95 angstrom line is detected toward all but one source, while the weaker KI 7698.96 angstrom line in about two thirds of the sample. The similarity in their peak centroids and the significant positive correlation between their equivalent widths demonstrate that these transitions trace the same atomic gas. The absorption lines are present towards both disk and diskless young stellar objects, which excludes cold gas within the circumstellar disk as the absorbing material. A comparison of NaI and CO detections and peak centroids demonstrates that the atomic and molecular gas are not co-located, the atomic gas is more extended than the molecular gas. The width of the atomic lines corroborates this finding and points to atomic gas about an order of magnitude warmer than the molecular gas. The distribution of NaI radial velocities shows a clear spatial gradient along the length of the Taurus molecular cloud filaments. This suggests that absorption is associated with the Taurus molecular cloud. Assuming the gradient is due to cloud rotation, the rotation of the atomic gas is consistent with differential galactic rotation while the rotation of the molecular gas, although with the same rotation axis, is retrograde. Our analysis shows that narrow NaI and KI absorption resonance lines are useful tracers of the atomic envelope of molecular clouds. In line with recent findings from giant molecular clouds, our results demonstrate that the velocity fields of the atomic and molecular gas are misaligned. The angular momentum of a molecular cloud is not simply inherited from the rotating Galactic disk from which it formed but may be redistributed by cloud-cloud interactions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the photometric calibration of data taken with the near-infrared Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). The broad-band ZYJHK data are directly calibrated from Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources which are abundant in every WFCAM pointing. We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the ~5per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to ~=1.5per cent for the JHK bands and 2per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B - V)', but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards. Finally, we present empirically determined throughput measurements for WFCAM.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Submillimeter Array to image, at ~1" resolution, C2H(3-2) emission from the molecule-rich circumstellar disks orbiting the nearby, classical T Tauri star systems TW Hya and V4046 Sgr. The SMA imaging reveals that the C2H emission exhibits a ring-like morphology within each disk, the inner hole radius of the C2H ring within the V4046 Sgr disk (~70 AU) is somewhat larger than than of its counterpart within the TW Hya disk (~45 AU). We suggest that, in each case, the C2H emission likely traces irradiation of the tenuous surface layers of the outer disks by high-energy photons from the central stars.},

	Abstract = {V1184 Tau (CB 34V) lies in the field of the Bok globule CB 34 and was discovered as a large amplitude variable in 1993. According to the first hypothesis of the variability of the star, it is a FU Orionis candidate erupted between 1951 and 1993. During subsequent observations, the star manifests large amplitude variability interpreted as obscuration from circumstellar clouds of dust. We included V1184 Tau (CB 34V) in our target list of highly variable pre-main-sequence stars to determine the reasons for the variations in the brightness of this object. Data from BVRI photometric observations of the young stellar object V1184 Tau, obtained in the period 2008-2015, are presented in the paper. These data are a continuation of our optical photometric monitoring of the star began in 2000 and continuing to date. The photometric observations of V1184 Tau were performed in two observatories with two medium-sized and two small telescopes. Our results indicate that during periods of maximum light the star shows characteristics typical of T Tauri stars. During the observed deep minimum in brightness, however, V1184 Tau is rather similar to UX Orionis objects. The deep drop in brightness began in 2003 ended in 2015 as the star has returned to maximum light. The light curve during the drop is obviously asymmetric as the decrease in brightness lasts two times longer than the rise. The observed colour reverse on the colour-magnitude diagrams is also confirmation of obscuration from circumstellar clouds of dust as a reason for the large amplitude variability in the brightness.},

	Abstract = {The small molecular cloud Lynds 1634 contains at least three outflow sources. We found one of these, IRS 7, to be variable with a period of 37.14 +/- 0.04 days and an amplitude of approximately 2 mag in the Ks band. The light curve consists of a quiescent phase with little or no variation, and a rapid outburst phase. During the outburst phase, the rapid brightness variation generates light echoes that propagate into the surrounding molecular cloud, allowing a measurement of the distance to IRS 7 of 404 pc +/- 35 pc. We observed only a marginally significant change in the H - K color during the outburst phase. The K-band spectrum of IRS 7 shows CO bandhead emission but its equivalent width does not change significantly with the phase of the light curve. The H_2 1-0 S(1) line emission does not follow the variability of the continuum flux. We also used the imaging data for a proper motion study of the outflows originating from the IRS 7 and the FIR source IRAS 05173-0555, and confirm that these are indeed distinct outflows.},

It concerns the primordial disks of intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects in embedded and optically revealed phases. The properties were derived from spatially resolved observations and therefore predominantly obtained with interferometric means, either in the radio/(sub)millimeter or in the optical/infrared wavelength regions. We make summaries and comparisons of the physical properties, kinematics, and dynamics of these circumstellar structures and delineate trends where possible. Amongst others, we report on a quadratic trend of mass accretion rates with mass from T Tauri stars to the highest mass young stellar objects and on the systematic difference in mass infall and accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {V1180 Cas is a young variable that has shown strong photometric fluctuations (Delta_I~6mag) in the recent past, which have been attributed to events of enhanced accretion. The source has entered a new high-brightness state in Sept.2013, which we have previously analyzed through optical and near-IR spectroscopy. To investigate the current active phase of V1180 Cas, we performed observations with the Chandra satellite to study the X-ray emission from the object and its connection to accretion episodes. Chandra observations were performed in early Aug.2014. Complementary JHK photometry and J-band spectra were taken at our Campo Imperatore facility to relate the X-ray and near-IR emission from the target. We observe a peak of X-ray emission at the nominal position of V1180 Cas. This signal corresponds to an X-ray luminosity L_X(0.5-7 kev) in the range 0.8-2.2e30 erg/s. Based on the relatively short duration of the dim states in the light curve and on stellar luminosity considerations, we explored the possibility that the brightness minima of V1180 Cas are driven by extinction variations. From the analysis of the spectral energy distribution of the high state we infer a stellar luminosity of 0.8-0.9 Lsun and find that the derived L_X is comparable to the average X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars. Moreover, the X-ray luminosity is lower than the X-ray emission levels of 5e30 -1e31 erg/s detected at outbursts in similar low-mass objects. Our analysis suggests that at least part of the photometric fluctuations of V1180 Cas might be extinction effects rather than the result of accretion excess emission. However, as the source displays spectral features indicative of active accretion, we speculate that its photometric variations might be the result of a combination of accretion-induced and extinction-driven effects, as suggested for other young variables, such as V1184 Tau and V2492 Cyg.},

	Abstract = {We present new results from the Disks@EVLA program for two young stars: CY Tau and DoAr 25. We trace continuum emission arising from their circusmtellar disks from spatially resolved observations, down to tens of AU scales, at {\lambda} = 0.9, 2.8, 8.0, and 9.8 mm for DoAr25 and at {\lambda} = 1.3, 2.8, and 7.1 mm for CY Tau. Additionally, we constrain the amount of emission whose origin is different from thermal dust emission from 5 cm observations. Directly from interferometric data, we find that observations at 7 mm and 1 cm trace emission from a compact disk while millimeter-wave observations trace an extended disk structure. From a physical disk model, where we characterize the disk structure of CY Tau and DoAr 25 at wavelengths shorter than 5 cm, we find that (1) dust continuum emission is optically thin at the observed wavelengths and over the spatial scales studied, (2) a constant value of the dust opacity is not warranted by our observations, and (3) a high-significance radial gradient of the dust opacity spectral index, {\beta}, is consistent with the observed dust emission in both disks, with low-{\beta} in the inner disk and high-{\beta} in the outer disk. Assuming that changes in dust properties arise solely due to changes in the maximum particle size (amax), we constrain radial variations of amax in both disks, from cm-sized particles in the inner disk (R < 40 AU) to millimeter sizes in the outer disk (R > 80 AU). These observational constraints agree with theoretical predictions of the radial-drift barrier, however, fragmentation of dust grains could explain our amax(R) constraints if these disks have lower turbulence and/or if dust can survive high-velocity collisions.},

	Abstract = {We study the energy-release process in the confined X1.6 flare that occurred on 22 October 2014 in AR 12171. Magnetic-reconnection rates and reconnection fluxes are derived from three different data sets: space-based data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 1600 {\AA} filter onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and ground-based H$\alpha$ and Ca II K filtergrams from Kanzelh\"ohe Observatory. The magnetic-reconnection rates determined from the three data sets all closely resemble the temporal profile of the hard X-rays measured by the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), which are a proxy for the flare energy released into high-energy electrons. The total magnetic-reconnection flux derived lies between $4.1 \times 10^{21}$ Mx (AIA 1600 {\AA}) and $7.9 \times 10^{21}$ Mx (H$\alpha$), which corresponds to about 2 to 4% of the total unsigned flux of the strong source AR. Comparison of the magnetic-reconnection flux dependence on the GOES class for 27 eruptive events collected from previous studies (covering B to $>$X10 class flares) reveals a correlation coefficient of $\approx 0.8$ in double-logarithmic space. The confined X1.6 class flare under study lies well within the distribution of the eruptive flares. The event shows a large initial separation of the flare ribbons and no separation motion during the flare. In addition, we note enhanced emission at flare-ribbon structures and hot loops connecting these structures before the event starts. These observations are consistent with the emerging-flux model, where newly emerging small flux tubes reconnect with pre-existing large coronal loops.},

@article{pad15a,
	Abstract = {The main signature of the interaction between cosmic rays and molecular clouds is the high ionisation degree. This decreases towards the densest parts of a cloud, where star formation is expected, because of energy losses and magnetic effects. However recent observations hint to high levels of ionisation in protostellar systems, therefore leading to an apparent contradiction that could be explained by the presence of energetic particles accelerated within young protostars. Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient particle acceleration through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We find that jet shocks can be strong accelerators of protons which can be boosted up to relativistic energies. Another possibly efficient acceleration site is located at protostellar surfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough to accelerate protons. Our results demonstrate the possibility of accelerating particles during the early phase of a proto-Solar-like system and can be used as an argument to support available observations. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the star and planet formation process as well as on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.},

	Abstract = {We present the initial results of our investigation of the star-forming complex W49, one of the youngest and most luminous massive star forming regions in our Galaxy. We used Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) data to investigate massive star formation with the primary objective to locate a representative set of protostars and the clusters of young stars that are forming around them. We present our source catalog with the mosaics from the IRAC data. In this study we used a combination of IRAC, MIPS, Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and UKIRT Deep Infrared Sky Survey (UKIDSS) data to identify and classify the Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We identified 232 Class 0/I YSOs, 907 Class II YSOs, and 74 transition disk candidate objects using color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. In addition, to understand the evolution of star formation in W49 we analysed the distribution of YSOs in the region to identify clusters using a minimal spanning tree method. The fraction of YSOs that belong to clusters with >7 members is found to be 52% for a cut-off distance of 96" and the ratio of Class II/I objects is 2.1. We compared the W49 region to the G305 and G333 star forming regions and concluded that the W49 has the richest population with 7 subclusters of YSOs.},

	Abstract = {Interstellar reddening corrections are necessary to reconstruct the intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accreting protostellar systems. The stellar SED determines the heating and chemical processes that can occur in circumstellar disks. Measurement of neutral hydrogen absorption against broad Lyalpha emission profiles in young stars can be used to obtain the total H I column density (N(H I)) along the line of sight. We measure N(H I) with new and archival ultraviolet observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of 31 classical T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. The H I column densities range from log10(N(H I)) ≈19.6-21.1, with corresponding visual extinctions of AV =0.02-0.72 mag, assuming an RV of 3.1. We find that the majority of the H I absorption along the line of sight likely comes from interstellar rather than circumstellar material. Extinctions derived from new HST blue-optical spectral analyses, previous IR and optical measurements, and new X-ray column densities on average overestimate the interstellar extinction toward young stars compared to the N(H I) values by ~0.6 mag. We discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy in the context of a protoplanetary disk geometry.},

	Abstract = {AA Tau is a well-studied, nearby classical T Tauri star, which is viewed almost edge-on. A warp in its inner disk periodically eclipses the central star, causing a clear modulation of its optical light curve. The system underwent a major dimming event beginning in 2011 caused by an extra absorber, which is most likely associated with additional disk material in the line of sight toward the central source. We present new XMM-Newton X-ray, Hubble Space Telescope FUV, and ground based optical and near-infrared data of the system obtained in 2013 during the long-lasting dim phase. The line width decrease of the fluorescent H$_2$ disk emission shows that the extra absorber is located at $r>1\,$au. Comparison of X-ray absorption ($N_H$) with dust extinction ($A_V$), as derived from measurements obtained one inner disk orbit (eight days) after the X-ray measurement, indicates that the gas-to-dust ratio as probed by the $N_H$ to $A_V$ ratio of the extra absorber is compatible with the ISM ratio. Combining both results suggests that the extra absorber, i.e., material at $r>1\,$au, has no significant gas excess in contrast to the elevated gas-to-dust ratio previously derived for material in the inner region ($\lesssim0.1\,$au).},

	Abstract = {In this contribution talk we summarize the results of our ongoing project of detailed analysis of the chemical content (chemical tagging) as a promising powerful method to provide clear constraints on the membership of FGK kinematic candidates to stellar kinematic groups of different ages that can be used as an alternative or complementary to the methods that use kinematics, photometry or age indicators. This membership information is very important to better understand the star formation history in the solar neighborhood discerning between field-like stars (associated with dynamical resonances (bar) or spiral structure) and real physical structures of coeval stars with a common origin (debris of star-forming aggregates in the disk). We have already applied the chemical tagging method to constrain the membership of FGK candidate stars to the Hyades supercluster and the Ursa Major moving group and in this contribution we present the preliminary results of our study of the Castor moving group.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained ALMA Band 7 observations of the FU Ori outburst system at 0.6"x0.5" resolution to measure the link between the inner disk instability and the outer disk through sub-mm continuum and molecular line observations. Our observations detect continuum emission which can be well modeled by two unresolved sources located at the position of each binary component. The interferometric observations recover the entire flux reported in previous single-dish studies, ruling out the presence of a large envelope. Assuming that the dust is optically thin, we derive disk dust masses of $2\times 10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$ and $8\times 10^{-5}$M$_{\odot}$, for the north and south components respectively. We place limits on the disks' radii of $r<$45 AU. We report the detection of molecular emission from $^{12}$CO(3-2), HCO$^{+}$(4-3) and from HCN(4-3). The $^{12}$CO appears widespread across the two binary components, and is slightly more extended than the continuum emission. The denser gas tracer HCO$^{+}$ peaks close to the position of the southern binary component, while HCN appears peaked at the position of the northern component. This suggests that the southern binary component is embedded in denser molecular material, consistent with previous studies that indicate a heavily reddened object. At this angular resolution any interaction between the two unresolved disk components cannot be disentangled. Higher resolution images are vital to understanding the process of star formation via rapid accretion FU Ori-type episodes.},

	Abstract = {Investigating the molecular gas in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks provides insight into how the molecular disk environment changes during the transition from primordial to debris disk systems. We conduct a small survey of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) fluorescent emission, using 14 well-studied Classical T Tauri stars at two distinct dust disk evolutionary stages, to explore how the structure of the inner molecular disk changes as the optically thick warm dust dissipates. We simulate the observed HI-Lyman $\alpha$-pumped H$_2$ disk fluorescence by creating a 2D radiative transfer model that describes the radial distributions of H$_{2}$ emission in the disk atmosphere and compare these to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. We find the radial distributions that best describe the observed H$_2$ FUV emission arising in primordial disk targets (full dust disk) are demonstrably different than those of transition disks (little-to-no warm dust observed). For each best-fit model, we estimate inner and outer disk emission boundaries (r$_{in}$ and r$_{out}$), describing where the bulk of the observed H$_2$ emission arises in each disk, and we examine correlations between these and several observational disk evolution indicators, such as n$_{13-31}$, r$_{in,CO}$, and the mass accretion rate. We find strong, positive correlations between the H$_2$ radial distributions and the slope of the dust SED, implying the behavior of the molecular disk atmosphere changes as the inner dust clears in evolving protoplanetary disks. Overall, we find that H$_2$ inner radii are $\sim$4 times larger in transition systems, while the bulk of the H$_2$ emission originates inside the dust gap radius for all transitional sources.},

	Abstract = {We report results of a spectropolarimetric and photometric monitoring of the weak-line T Tauri stars (wTTSs) V819 Tau and V830 Tau within the MaTYSSE programme, involving the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. At ~3 Myr, both stars dissipated their discs recently and are interesting objects for probing star and planet formation. Profile distortions and Zeeman signatures are detected in the unpolarized and circularly-polarized lines, whose rotational modulation we modelled using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps for both stars. We find that the large-scale magnetic fields of V819 Tau and V830 Tau are mostly poloidal and can be approximated at large radii by 350-400 G dipoles tilted at ~30 degrees to the rotation axis. They are significantly weaker than the field of GQ Lup, an accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) with similar mass and age which can be used to compare the magnetic properties of wTTSs and cTTSs. The reconstructed brightness maps of both stars include cool spots and warm plages. Surface differential rotation is small, typically ~4.4x smaller than on the Sun, in agreement with previous results on wTTSs. Using our Doppler images to model the activity jitter and filter it out from the radial velocity (RV) curves, we obtain RV residuals with dispersions of 0.033 and 0.104 km/s for V819 Tau and V830 Tau respectively. RV residuals suggest that a hot Jupiter may be orbiting V830 Tau, though additional data are needed to confirm this preliminary result. We find no evidence for close-in giant planet around V819 Tau.},

	Abstract = {Context. Stellar differential rotation is important for understanding hydromagnetic stellar dynamos, instabilities, and transport processes in stellar interiors, as well as for a better treatment of tides in close binary and star-planet systems.  Aims: We introduce a method of measuring a lower limit to the amplitude of surface differential rotation from high-precision, evenly sampled photometric time series, such as those obtained by space-borne telescopes. It is designed to be applied to main-sequence late-type stars whose optical flux modulation is dominated by starspots.  Methods: An autocorrelation of the time series was used to select stars that allow an accurate determination of starspot rotation periods. A simple two-spot model was applied together with a Bayesian information criterion to preliminarily select intervals of the time series showing evidence of differential rotation with starspots of almost constant area. Finally, the significance of the differential rotation detection and a measurement of its amplitude and uncertainty were obtained by an a posteriori Bayesian analysis based on a Monte Carlo Markov chain approach. We applied our method to the Sun and eight other stars for which previous spot modelling had been performed to compare our results with previous ones.  Results: We find that autocorrelation is a simple method for selecting stars with a coherent rotational signal that is a prerequisite for successfully measuring differential rotation through spot modelling. For a proper Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis, it is necessary to take the strong correlations among different parameters that exist in spot modelling into account. For the planet-hosting star Kepler-30, we derive a lower limit to the relative amplitude of the differential rotation of DeltaP/P = 0.0523 $\pm$ 0.0016. We confirm that the Sun as a star in the optical passband is not suitable for measuring differential rotation owing to the rapid evolution of its photospheric active regions. In general, our method performs well in comparison to more sophisticated and time-consuming approaches.},

	Abstract = {Recent Hubble Space Telescope images have allowed the determination with unprecedented accuracy of motions and changes of shocks within the inner Orion Nebula. These originate from collimated outflows from very young stars, some within the ionized portion of the nebula and others within the host molecular cloud. We have doubled the number of Herbig-Haro objects known within the inner Orion Nebula. We find that the best-known Herbig-Haro shocks originate from a relatively few stars, with the optically visible X-ray source COUP 666 driving many of them. While some isolated shocks are driven by single collimated outflows, many groups of shocks are the result of a single stellar source having jets oriented in multiple directions at similar times. This explains the feature that shocks aligned in opposite directions in the plane of the sky are usually blue shifted because the redshifted outflows pass into the optically thick Photon Dominated Region behind the nebula. There are two regions from which optical outflows originate for which there are no candidate sources in the SIMBAD data base.},

	Abstract = {Studies of molecular clouds and young stars near the sun have provided invaluable insights into the process of star formation. Indeed, much of our physical understanding of this topic has been derived from such studies. Perhaps the two most fundamental problems confronting star formation research today are: 1) determining the origin of stellar mass and 2) deciphering the nature of the physical processes that control the star formation rate in molecular gas. As I will briefly outline here, observations and studies of local star forming regions are making particularly significant contributions toward the solution of both these important problems.},

@article{sim15a,
	Abstract = {We characterize magnetically driven accretion at radii between 1 au and 100 au in protoplanetary discs, using a series of local non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The simulations assume a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) disc that is threaded by a net vertical magnetic field of specified strength. Confirming previous results, we find that the Hall effect has only a modest impact on accretion at 30 au, and essentially none at 100 au. At 1-10 au the Hall effect introduces a pronounced bi-modality in the accretion process, with vertical magnetic fields aligned to the disc rotation supporting a strong laminar Maxwell stress that is absent if the field is anti-aligned. In the anti-aligned case, we instead find evidence for bursts of turbulent stress at 5-10 au, which we tentatively identify with the non-axisymmetric Hall-shear instability. The presence or absence of these bursts depends upon the details of the adopted chemical model, which suggests that appreciable regions of actual protoplanetary discs might lie close to the borderline between laminar and turbulent behaviour. Given the number of important control parameters that have already been identified in MHD models, quantitative predictions for disc structure in terms of only radius and accretion rate appear to be difficult. Instead, we identify robust qualitative tests of magnetically driven accretion. These include the presence of turbulence in the outer disc, independent of the orientation of the vertical magnetic fields, and a Hall-mediated bi-modality in turbulent properties extending from the region of thermal ionization to 10 au.},

We combine our results with measurements reported in the literature to analyze the orbital motion for each binary. We present preliminary orbits for DF Tau, T Tau S, ZZ Tau, and the Pleiades binary HBC 351. Seven additional binaries show curvature in their relative motion. Currently, we can place lower limits on the orbital periods for these systems; full solutions will be possible with more orbital coverage. Five other binaries show motion that is indistinguishable from linear motion. We suspect that these systems are bound and might show curvature with additional measurements in the future. The observations reported herein lay critical groundwork toward the goal of measuring precise masses for low-mass PMS stars.},

	Abstract = {We present 237 new spectroscopically confirmed pre-main-sequence K- and M-type stars in the young Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco-Cen association, the nearest region of recent massive star formation. Using the Wide-Field Spectrograph at the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring, we observed 397 kinematically and photometrically selected candidate members of Upper Scorpius, and identified new members by the presence of lithium absorption. The HR-diagram of the new members shows a spread of ages, ranging from ˜3 to 20 Myr, which broadly agrees with the current age estimates of ˜5-10 Myr. We find a significant range of Li 6708 equivalent widths among the members, and a minor dependence of HR-diagram position on the measured equivalent width of the Li 6708 {\AA} line, with members that appear younger having more lithium. This could indicate the presence of either populations of different age, or a spread of ages in Upper Scorpius. We also use Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer data to infer circumstellar disc presence in 25 of the members on the basis of infrared excesses, including two candidate transition discs. We find that 11.2 $\pm$ 3.4 per cent of the M0-M2 spectral type (0.4-0.8 M&sun;) Upper Sco stars display an excess that indicates the presence of a gaseous disc.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged*) Models of the young solar nebula assume a hot initial disk with most volatiles are in the gas phase. The question remains whether an actively accreting disk is warm enough to have gas-phase water up to 50 AU radius. No detailed studies have yet been performed on the extent of snowlines in an embedded accreting disk (Stage 0). Quantify the location of gas-phase volatiles in embedded actively accreting disk system. Two-dimensional physical and radiative transfer models have been used to calculate the temperature structure of embedded protostellar systems. Gas and ice abundances of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO are calculated using the density-dependent thermal desorption formulation. The midplane water snowline increases from 3 to 55 AU for accretion rates through the disk onto the star between $10^{-9}$-$10^{-4} \ M_{\odot} \ {\rm yr^{-1}}$. CO$_2$ can remain in the solid phase within the disk for $\dot{M} \leq 10^{-5} \ M_{\odot} \ {\rm yr^{-1}}$ down to $\sim 20$ AU. Most of the CO is in the gas phase within an actively accreting disk independent of disk properties and accretion rate. The predicted optically thin water isotopolog emission is consistent with the detected H$_2^{18}$O emission toward the Stage 0 embedded young stellar objects, originating from both the disk and the warm inner envelope (hot core). An accreting embedded disk can only account for water emission arising from $R < 50$ AU, however, and the extent rapidly decreases for low accretion rates. Thus, the radial extent of the emission can be measured with ALMA observations and compared to this limit. Volatiles sublimate out to 50 AU in young disks and can reset the chemical content inherited from the envelope in periods of high accretion rates. A hot young solar nebula out to 30 AU can only have occurred during the deeply embedded Stage 0, not during the T-Tauri phase of our early solar system.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the accretion rates of 235 Classical T Tauri star (CTTS) candidates in the Lagoon Nebula using $ugri$H$\alpha$ photometry from the VPHAS+ survey. Our sample consists of stars displaying H$\alpha$-excess, the intensity of which is used to derive accretion rates. For a subset of 87 stars, the intensity of the $u$-band excess is also used to estimate accretion rates. We find the mean variation in accretion rates measured using H$\alpha$ and $u$-band intensities to be $\sim$ 0.17 dex, agreeing with previous estimates (0.04-0.4 dex) but for a much larger sample. The spatial distribution of CTTS align with the location of protostars and molecular gas suggesting that they retain an imprint of the natal gas fragmentation process. Strong accretors are concentrated spatially, while weak accretors are more distributed. Our results do not support the sequential star forming processes suggested in the literature.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the extent to which the Palomar-Green (PG) Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) is complete and representative of the general quasar population by comparing it with imaging and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). A comparison of SDSS and PG photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the need to apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the PG data. Using the SDSS photometric catalog, we define the PG's parent sample of objects that are not main-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parent sample using the PG photometric criteria and errors. This simulation shows that the effective U-B cut in the PG survey is U-B<-0.71, implying a color-related incompleteness. As the color distribution of bright quasars peaks near U-B=-0.7 and the 2 sigma error in U-B is comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the color incompleteness of the BQS is approximately 50% and essentially random with respect to U-B color for z<0.5. There is, however, a bias against bright quasars at 0.5<z<1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation of quasars (although quasars at z>0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in any case). We find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness when comparing the distributions in color, redshift, and FIRST radio properties of the BQS and a BQS-like subsample of the SDSS quasar sample. However, the application of a bright magnitude limit biases the BQS toward the inclusion of objects that are blue in g-i, in particular compared to the full range of g-i colors found among the i-band limited SDSS quasars, and even at i-band magnitudes comparable to those of the BQS objects.},

	Abstract = {We have identified outflows and bubbles in the Taurus molecular cloud based on the $\sim 100$ deg$^2$ Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) maps and the Spitzer young stellar object catalogs. In the main 44 deg$^2$ area of Taurus we found 55 outflows, of which 31 were previously unknown. We also found 37 bubbles in the entire 100 deg$^2$ area of Taurus, all of which had not been found before. The total kinetic energy of the identified outflows is estimated to be $\bf \sim 3.9 \times 10^{45}$ erg, which is \textbf{1\%} of the cloud turbulent energy. The total kinetic energy of the detected bubbles is estimated to be $\sim 9.2 \times 10^{46}$ erg, which is 29\% of the turbulent energy of Taurus. The energy injection rate from outflows is $\bf \sim 1.3 \times 10^{33}~\rm erg\ s^{-1}$, \textbf{0.4 - 2 times} the dissipation rate of the cloud turbulence. The energy injection rate from bubbles is $\sim 6.4 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, \textbf{2 - 10 times} the turbulent dissipation rate of the cloud. The gravitational binding energy of the cloud is $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{48}$ {\bf erg}, \textbf{385} and 16 times the energy of outflows and bubbles, respectively. We conclude that neither outflows nor bubbles can \textbf{provide enough energy to balance the overall gravitational binding energy and the turbulent energy of Taurus. However,} in the current epoch, stellar feedback is sufficient to maintain the observed turbulence in Taurus.},

	Abstract = {Context. In recent years new observations of pre-main sequence stars (pre-MS) with Z <= Z&sun; have been made available. To take full advantage of the continuously growing amount of data of pre-MS stars in different environments, we need to develop updated pre-MS models for a wide range of metallicity to assign reliable ages and masses to the observed stars.  Aims: We present updated evolutionary pre-MS models and isochrones for a fine grid of mass, age, metallicity, and helium values.  Methods: We use a standard and well-tested stellar evolutionary code (i.e. FRANEC), that adopts outer boundary conditions from detailed and realistic atmosphere models. In this code, we incorporate additional improvements to the physical inputs related to the equation of state and the low temperature radiative opacities essential to computing low-mass stellar models.  Results: We make available via internet a large database of pre-MS tracks and isochrones for a wide range of chemical compositions (Z = 0.0002-0.03), masses (M = 0.2-7.0 M&sun;), and ages (1-100 Myr) for a solar-calibrated mixing length parameter alpha (i.e. 1.68). For each chemical composition, additional models were computed with two different mixing length values, namely alpha = 1.2 and 1.9. Moreover, for Z >= 0.008, we also provided models with two different initial deuterium abundances. The characteristics of the models have been discussed in detail and compared with other work in the literature. The main uncertainties affecting theoretical predictions have been critically discussed. Comparisons with selected data indicate that there is close agreement between theory and observation.  Tracks and isochrones are available on the web at the http://astro.df.unipi.it/stellar-models/Tracks and isochrones are also available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/533/A109},

	Abstract = {Herbig Ae/Be stars span a key mass range that links low and high mass stars, and thus provide an ideal window from which to explore their formation. This paper presents VLT/X-Shooter spectra of 91 Herbig Ae/Be stars, HAeBes; the largest spectroscopic study of HAeBe accretion to date. A homogeneous approach to determining stellar parameters is undertaken for the majority of the sample. Measurements of the ultra-violet (UV) are modelled within the context of magnetospheric accretion, allowing a direct determination of mass accretion rates. Multiple correlations are observed across the sample between accretion and stellar properties: the youngest and often most massive stars are the strongest accretors, and there is an almost 1:1 relationship between the accretion luminosity and stellar luminosity. Despite these overall trends of increased accretion rates in HAeBes when compared to classical T Tauri stars, we also find noticeable differences in correlations when considering the Herbig Ae and Herbig Be subsets. This, combined with the difficulty in applying a magnetospheric accretion model to some of the Herbig Be stars, could suggest that another form of accretion may be occurring within the Herbig Be mass range.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the physical properties of stellar clusters that are detected in massive star-forming regions in the MYStIX project--a comparative, multiwavelength study of young stellar clusters within 3.6 kpc that contain at least one O-type star. Tabulated properties of subclusters in these regions include physical sizes and shapes, intrinsic numbers of stars, absorptions by the molecular clouds, and median subcluster ages. Physical signs of dynamical evolution are present in the relations of these properties, including statistically significant correlations between subcluster size, central density, and age, which are likely the result of cluster expansion after gas removal. We argue that many of the subclusters identified in Paper I are gravitationally bound because their radii are significantly less than what would be expected from freely expanding clumps of stars with a typical initial stellar velocity dispersion of ~3 km/s for star-forming regions. We explore a model for cluster formation in which structurally simpler clusters are built up hierarchically through the mergers of subclusters--subcluster mergers are indicated by an inverse relation between the numbers of stars in a subcluster and their central densities (also seen as a density vs. radius relation that is less steep than would be expected from pure expansion). We discuss implications of these effects for the dynamical relaxation of young stellar clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a spectroscopic Spitzer and Herschel mid-to-far-infrared study of the circumbinary disk orbiting the evolved (age ~12-23 Myr) close binary T Tauri system V4046 Sgr. Spitzer IRS spectra show emission lines of [Ne II], H_2 S(1), CO_2 and HCN, while Herschel PACS and SPIRE spectra reveal emission from [O I], OH, and tentative detections of H_2O and high-J transitions of CO. We measure [Ne III]/[Ne II] < 0.13, which is comparable to other X-ray/EUV luminous T Tauri stars that lack jets. We use the H_2 S(1) line luminosity to estimate the gas mass in the relatively warm surface layers of the inner disk. The presence of [O I] emission suggests that CO, H_2O, and/or OH is being photodissociated, and the lack of [C I] emission suggests any excess C may be locked up in HCN, CN and other organic molecules. Modeling of silicate dust grain emission features in the mid-infrared indicates that the inner disk is composed mainly of large (r~5 um) amorphous pyroxene and olivine grains (~86% by mass) with a relatively large proportion of crystalline silicates. These results are consistent with other lines of evidence indicating that planet building is ongoing in regions of the disk within ~30 AU of the central, close binary.},

Observations of nearby star-forming regions with the Herschel Space Observatory complement our view of the protoplanetary disks in Ophiuchus with information about the outer disks. Aims. The main goal of this project is to provide new far-infrared fluxes for the known disks in the core region of Ophiuchus and to identify potential transitional disks using data from Herschel. Methods. We obtained PACS and SPIRE photometry of previously spectroscopically confirmed young stellar objects (YSO) in the region and analysed their spectral energy distributions. Results. From an initial sample of 261 objects with spectral types in Ophiuchus, we detect 49 disks in at least one Herschel band. We provide new far-infrared fluxes for these objects. One of them is clearly a new transitional disk candidate. Conclusions. The data from Herschel Space Observatory provides fluxes that complement previous infrared data and that we use to identify a new transitional disk candidate.},

	Abstract = {We present an IR-monitoring survey with the $Spitzer$ Space Telescope of the star forming region GGD 12-15. Over 1000 objects were monitored including about 350 objects within the central 5 arcminutes which is found to be especially dense in cluster members. The monitoring took place over 38 days and is part of the Young Stellar Object VARiability (YSOVAR) project. The region was also the subject of a contemporaneous 67ks $Chandra$ observation. The field includes 119 previously identified pre-main sequence star candidates. X-rays are detected from 164 objects, 90 of which are identified with cluster members. Overall, we find that about half the objects in the central 5 arcminutes are young stellar objects based on a combination of their spectral energy distribution, IR variability and X-ray emission. Most of the stars with IR excess relative to a photosphere show large amplitude (>0.1 mag) mid-IR variability. There are 39 periodic sources, all but one of these is found to be a cluster member. Almost half of the periodic sources do not show IR excesses. Overall, more than 85% of the Class I, flat spectrum, and Class II sources are found to vary. The amplitude of the variability is larger in more embedded young stellar objects. Most of the Class~I/II objects exhibit redder colors in a fainter state, compatible with time-variable extinction. A few become bluer when fainter, which can be explained with significant changes in the structure of the inner disk. A search for changes in the IR due to X-ray events is carried out, but the low number of flares prevented an analysis of the direct impact of X-ray flares on the IR lightcurves. However, we find that X-ray detected Class II sources have longer timescales for change in the mid-IR than a similar set of non-X-ray detected Class IIs.},

	Abstract = {Correlations between the accretion luminosity and emission line luminosities (L_acc and L_line) of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have been published for many different spectral lines, which are used to estimate accretion rates. Despite the origin of those correlations is unknown, this could be attributed to direct or indirect physical relations between the emission line formation and the accretion mechanism. This work shows that all (near-UV/optical/near-IR) L_acc-L_line correlations are the result of the fact that the accretion luminosity and the stellar luminosity (L_star) are correlated, and are not necessarily related with the physical origin of the line. Synthetic and observational data are used to illustrate how the L_acc-L_line correlations depend on the L_acc-L_star relationship. We conclude that because PMS stars show the L_acc-L_star correlation immediately implies that L_acc also correlates with the luminosity of all emission lines, for which the L_acc-L_line correlations alone do not prove any physical connection with accretion but can only be used with practical purposes to roughly estimate accretion rates. When looking for correlations with possible physical meaning, we suggest that L_acc/L_star and L_line/L_star should be used instead of L_acc and L_line. Finally, the finding that L_acc has a steeper dependence on L_star for T-Tauri stars than for intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars is also discussed. That is explained from the magnetospheric accretion scenario and the different photospheric properties in the near-UV.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a WISE (Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer) based study to identify and characterize young stellar objects (YSOs) in 12x12 degree Perseus OB2 association. Spectral energy distribution (SED) slope in range of 3.4-12 micron and a 5sigma selection criteria were used to select our initial sample. Further manual inspection reduced our final catalog to 156 known and 119 YSO candidate. The spatial distribution of newly found YSOs all over the field shows an older generation of star formation which most of its massive members have evolved into main sequence stars. In contrast, the majority of younger members lie within the Perseus molecular cloud and currently active star forming clusters such as NGC1333 and IC348. We also identified additional 66 point sources which passed YSO selection criteria but are likely AGB stars. However their spatial distribution suggests that they may contain a fraction of the YSOs. Comparing our results with the commonly used color-color selections, we found that while color selection method fails in picking up bright but evolved weak disks, our SED fitting method can identify such sources, including transitional disks. In addition we have less contamination with background sources such as galaxies, but in a price of loosing fainter (Jmag > 12) YSOs. Finally we employed a Bayesian Monte Carlo SED fitting method to determine the characteristics of each YSO candidate. Distribution of SED slopes and model driven age and mass confirms separated YSO populations with suggested three age groups of younger than 1 Myr old, 1-5 Myr old, and older than 5 Myrs which agrees with the age of Per OB2 association and currently star forming sites within the cloud.},

	Abstract = {Empirical calibrations of the stellar age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) rely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters. We used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M37, a 500-Myr-old open cluster that has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$). M37 was observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, to measure stellar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$), a proxy for coronal activity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster's membership catalog was revisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data and each star's distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive sample of 1699 M37 members: 426 with $P_{\rm rot}$, 278 with X-ray detections, and 76 with both. We calculate Rossby numbers, $R_o = P_{\rm rot}/\tau$, where $\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity, $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in our characterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. We find that fast rotators, for which $R_o<0.09\pm0.01$, show saturated levels of activity, with log($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\pm0.04$. For $R_o\geq0.09\pm0.01$, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of the form $R_o^\beta$, where $\beta$=$-2.03_{-0.14}^{+0.17}$. This is the largest sample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotation for a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4$-$1.3 $M_{\odot}$, $P_{\rm rot}$ in the range 0.4$-$12.8 d, and $L_{\rm X}$ in the range 10$^{28.4-30.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our results make M37 a new benchmark open cluster for calibrating the ARAR at ages of $\approx$500 Myr.},

	Abstract = {Two-ribbon brightenings are one of the most remarkable characteristics of an eruptive solar flare and are often used for predicting the occurrence of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Nevertheless, it was called in question recently whether all two-ribbon flares are eruptive. In this paper, we investigate a two ribbon-like white-light (WL) flare that is associated with a failed magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruption on 2015 January 13, which has no accompanying CME in the WL coronagraph. Observations by \textit{Optical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer} and \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} reveal that, with the increase of the flare emission and the acceleration of the unsuccessfully erupting MFR, two isolated kernels appear at the WL 3600 {\AA} passband and quickly develop into two elongated ribbon-like structures. The evolution of the WL continuum enhancement is completely coincident in time with the variation of \textit{Fermi} hard X-ray 26--50 keV flux. Increase of continuum emission is also clearly visible at the whole FUV and NUV passbands observed by \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph}. Moreover, in one WL kernel, the \ion{Si}{4}, \ion{C}{2}, and \ion{Mg}{2} h/k lines display significant enhancement and non-thermal broadening. However, their Doppler velocity pattern is location-dependent. At the strongly bright pixels, these lines exhibit a blueshift; while at moderately bright ones, the lines are generally redshifted. These results show that the failed MFR eruption is also able to produce a two-ribbon flare and high-energy electrons that heat the lower atmosphere, causing the enhancement of the WL and FUV/NUV continuum emissions and chromospheric evaporation.},

	Abstract = {By means of radiative transfer simulation we study the evolution of the far-infrared colours of protoplanetary discs undergoing inside-out dispersal, often referred to as transition discs. We show that a brightening of the mid and far-infrared emission from these objects is a natural consequence of the removal of the inner disc. Our results can fully explain recent observations of transition discs in the Chamaleon and Lupus star forming regions from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey, which show a higher median for the 70?um (Herschel PACS 1) band of known transition objects compared with primordial discs. Our theoretical results hence support the suggestion that the 70?um band may be a powerful diagnostic for the identi?cation of transition discs from photometry data, provided that the inner hole is larger than tens of AU, depending on spectral type. Furthermore we show that a comparison of photometry in the K , 12?um and 7u0?m bands to model tracks can provide a rough, but quick estimate of the inner hole size of these objects, provided their inclination is below ?85 degrees and the inner hole size is again larger than tens of AU.},

	Abstract = {Aims: In a recent study, we derived individual distances for 109 pre-main sequence stars that define the Lupus kinematic association of young stars. Here, we use these new distances to derive the masses and ages of Lupus T Tauri stars with the aim of better constraining the lifetime of their circumstellar disks. Methods: Using the photometric and spectroscopic information available in the literature, we computed the photospheric luminosity of 92 T Tauri stars in the Lupus association. Then, we estimated their masses and ages from theoretical evolutionary models. Based on Monte Carlo simulations and statistical tests, we compare the mass and age distribution of the classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and weak-line T Tauri (WTTS) in our sample. Results: We show that the CTTSs are on average younger than the WTTSs and that the probability that both T~Tauri subclasses are drawn from the same mass and age parental distribution is very low. Our results favor the scenario proposed earlier for the Taurus-Auriga association, where the CTTSs evolve into WTTSs when their disks are fully accreted by the star. Based on an empirical disk model, we find that the average disk lifetime for the T Tauri stars in the Lupus association is $\tau_{d}=3\times10^{6}\,(M_*/M_{\odot})^{0.55}$ yr. Conclusions: We find evidence that the average lifetime of the circumstellar disks in the Lupus association is shorter than in the Taurus-Auriga association and discuss the implications of this result.},

	Abstract = {A direct measure of the helium abundances from the near-infrared transition of He I at 1.08 mum is obtained for two nearly identical red giant stars in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. One star exhibits the He I line; the line is weak or absent in the other star. Detailed non-local thermal equilibrium semi-empirical models including expansion in spherical geometry are developed to match the chromospheric Halpha, Hbeta, and Ca II K lines, in order to predict the helium profile and derive a helium abundance. The red giant spectra suggest a helium abundance of Y <= 0.22 (LEID 54064) and Y = 0.39-0.44 (LEID 54084) corresponding to a difference in the abundance DeltaY >= 0.17. Helium is enhanced in the giant star (LEID 54084) that also contains enhanced aluminum and magnesium. This direct evaluation of the helium abundances gives observational support to the theoretical conjecture that multiple populations harbor enhanced helium in addition to light elements that are products of high-temperature hydrogen burning. We demonstrate that the 1.08 mum He I line can yield a helium abundance in cool stars when constraints on the semi-empirical chromospheric model are provided by other spectroscopic features.},

	Abstract = {Pre-main-sequence (PMS) models provide invaluable tools for the study of star-forming regions as they allow us to assign masses and ages to young stars. Thus, it is of primary importance to test the models against observations of PMS stars with dynamically determined masses. We developed a Bayesian method for testing the present generation of PMS models, which allows for a quantitative comparison with observations, largely superseding the widely used isochrones and tracks qualitative superposition.  Using the available PMS data, we tested the newest PISA PMS models, establishing good agreement with the observations. The data cover a mass range from ˜0.3 to ˜3.1 M&sun;, temperatures from ˜3 × 103 to ˜1.2 × 104 K and luminosities from ˜3 × 10-2 to ˜60 L&sun;. Masses are correctly predicted within 20 per cent of the observed values in most of the cases, and for some of them the difference is as small as 5 per cent. Nevertheless, some discrepancies are also observed and critically discussed.  By means of simulations, using typical observational errors, we evaluated the spread of log tausim- log taurec, i.e. simulated - recovered age distribution of the single objects. We also found that stars in binary systems simulated as coeval might be recovered as non-coeval, due to observational errors. The actual fraction of fake non-coevality is a complex function of the simulated ages, masses and mass ratios. We demonstrated that it is possible to recover the systems' ages with better precision than for single stars using the composite age-probability distribution, i.e. the product of the components' age distributions. Using this valuable tool, we estimated the ages of the presently observed PMS binary systems.},

	Abstract = {We examine the performance of standard pre-main-sequence (PMS) stellar evolution models against the accurately measured properties of a benchmark sample of 26 PMS stars in 13 eclipsing binary (EB) systems having masses 0.04-4.0 M&sun; and nominal ages ≈1-20 Myr. We provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental properties for the EBs, with a careful and consistent reassessment of observational uncertainties. We also provide a definitive compilation of the various PMS model sets, including physical ingredients and limits of applicability. No set of model isochrones is able to successfully reproduce all of the measured properties of all of the EBs. In the H-R diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by the models are accurate to better than 10% at ≳1 M&sun;, but below 1 M&sun; they are discrepant by 50-100%. Adjusting the observed radii and temperatures using empirical relations for the effects of magnetic activity helps to resolve the discrepancies in a few cases, but fails as a general solution. We find evidence that the failure of the models to match the data is linked to the triples in the EB sample; at least half of the EBs possess tertiary companions. Excluding the triples, the models reproduce the stellar masses to better than ~10% in the H-R diagram, down to 0.5 M&sun;, below which the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. We consider several mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the EB properties and thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. We show that the energies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentially explain the scatter in the EB properties through injection of heat, perhaps involving tidal interaction. It seems from the evidence at hand that this mechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surface properties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithium abundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. The EBs that are members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, but collectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreads in young clusters. However, this apparent spread in the EB ages may also be the result of scatter in the EB properties induced by tertiaries.},

@article{kra15a,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary models of pre-main sequence stars remain largely uncalibrated, especially for masses below that of the Sun, making each new dynamical mass and radius measurement a valuable test of theoretical models. Stellar mass dependent features of star formation (such as disk evolution, planet formation, and even the IMF) are fundamentally tied to these models, which implies a systematic uncertainty that can only be improved with precise measurements of calibrator stars. We present the discovery that UScoCTIO 5, a known spectroscopic binary (P = 34 days, Mtot sin(i) = 0.64 Msun), is an eclipsing system with both primary and secondary eclipses apparent in K2 light curves obtained during Campaign 2. We have simultaneously fit the eclipse profiles from the K2 light curves and the existing RV data to demonstrate that UScoCTIO 5 consists of a pair of nearly identical M4.5 stars with M_A = 0.329 +/- 0.002 Msun, R_A = 0.834 +/- 0.006 Rsun, M_B = 0.317 +/- 0.002 Msun, and R_B = 0.810 +/- 0.006 Rsun. The radii are broadly consistent with pre-main sequence ages predicted by stellar evolutionary models, but none agree to within the uncertainties. All models predict systematically incorrect masses at the 25--50% level for the HR diagram position of these mid-M dwarfs, suggesting significant modifications for any trend of other properties that vary with stellar mass. The form of the discrepancy for most model sets is not that they predict luminosities that are too low, but rather that they predict temperatures that are too high, suggesting that the models do not fully encompass the physics of energy transport (via convection and/or missing opacities) and/or a miscalibration of the SpT-Teff scale. The simplest modification to the models (changing Teff to match observations) would yield an older age for this system, in line with the recently proposed older age of Upper Scorpius (~11 Myr).},

	Abstract = {Using recently established empirical calibrations for the impact of chromospheric activity on the radii, effective temperatures, and estimated masses of active low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, we reassess the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) across the stellar/substellar boundary in the Upper Sco star-forming region (age ~ 5-10 Myr). We adjust the observed effective temperatures to warmer values using the observed strength of the chromospheric Halpha emission, and redetermine the estimated masses of objects using pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram. The effect of the activity-adjusted temperatures is to shift the objects to higher masses by 3%-100%. While the slope of the resulting IMF at substellar masses is not strongly changed, the peak of the IMF does shift from ≈0.06 to ≈0.11 M &sun;. Moreover, for objects with masses <~ 0.2 M &sun;, the ratio of brown dwarfs to stars changes from ~80% to ~33%. These results suggest that activity corrections are essential for studies of the substellar mass function, if the masses are estimated from spectral types or from effective temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Brown dwarfs are considered to be `failed stars' in the sense that they are born with masses between the least massive stars (0.072 solar masses, Msolar) and the most massive planets (~0.013Msolar); they therefore serve as a critical link in our understanding of the formation of both stars and planets. Even the most fundamental physical properties of brown dwarfs remain, however, largely unconstrained by direct measurement. Here we report the discovery of a brown-dwarf eclipsing binary system, in the Orion Nebula star-forming region, from which we obtain direct measurements of mass and radius for these newly formed brown dwarfs. Our mass measurements establish both objects as brown dwarfs, with masses of 0.054 +/- 0.005Msolar and 0.034 +/- 0.003Msolar. At the same time, with radii relative to the Sun's of 0.669 +/- 0.034Rsolar and 0.511 +/- 0.026Rsolar, these brown dwarfs are more akin to low-mass stars in size. Such large radii are generally consistent with theoretical predictions for young brown dwarfs in the earliest stages of gravitational contraction. Surprisingly, however, we find that the less-massive brown dwarf is the hotter of the pair; this result is contrary to the predictions of all current theoretical models of coeval brown dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {Abundances for alpha -elements and Fe in about 150 field subdwarfs and early subgiants with accurate parallaxes and kinematic data are used to discuss the run of abundance ratios in metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood. Based on kinematics, we separated stars into two populations: the first one has a positive velocity of rotation around the galactic center, and it is likely to be related to the dissipational collapse of the galaxy; the second one has either negligible or negative rotational velocity, and it is likely related to an accretion component. The two populations show a large overlap in metallicity. However, they show distinct chemical properties. For the first population we found that there are close correlations (with small scatters around) of the rotational velocity with metallicity and with the Fe/alpha  abundance ratio: this might be a signature of a not very fast collapse of the progenitor clouds, with enough time for a significant contribution by SNe Ia, although this result needs to be confirmed by a 3-D/non-LTE study. On the other side, the second population exhibits a larger scatter in both the above mentioned relations, and on average, a larger Fe/alpha  ratio at a given metallicity, suggesting a larger scatter in ages. We argue that the lack of stars with moderate rotational velocities and high Fe/alpha  abundance ratios is due to the short merging time for protogalactic clouds with prograde motion, while the presence of a group of counter-rotating stars with this characteristics indicates a much longer typical lifetimes for protogalactic fragments having such a motion. Finally, we found that perigalactic distances correlate with the Fe/alpha  abundance ratios better than the apogalactic distances.

	Abstract = {Resolved submillimeter imaging of transitional disks is increasingly revealing the complexity of disk structure. Here we present the first high-resolution submillimeter image of a recently identified transitional disk around IRAS 04125+2902 in the Taurus star-forming region. We measure an inner disk hole of ~20 AU around IRAS 04125+2902 by simultaneously modeling new 880 micron Submillimeter Array (SMA) data along with an existing spectral energy distribution supplemented by new Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) photometry. We also constrain the outer radius of the dust disk in IRAS~04125+2902 to ~50-60 AU. Such a small dust disk could be attributed to initial formation conditions, outward truncation by an unseen companion, or dust evolution in the disk. Notably, the dust distribution of IRAS 04125+2902 resembles a narrow ring (delta R ~ 35 AU) composed of large dust grains at the location of the disk wall. Such narrow dust rings are also seen in other transitional disks and may be evidence of dust trapping in pressure bumps, possibly produced by planetary companions. More sensitive submillimeter observations of the gas are necessary to further probe the physical mechanisms at work in shaping the spatial distribution of large dust in this disk. Interestingly, the IRAS 04125+2902 disk is significantly fainter than other transitional disks that have been resolved at submillimeter wavelengths, hinting that more objects with large disk holes may exist at the faint end of the submillimeter luminosity distribution that await detection with more sensitive imaging telescopes.},

	Abstract = {We present the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264, a continuous 30 day multi-wavelength photometric monitoring campaign on more than 1000 young cluster members using 16 telescopes. The unprecedented combination of multi-wavelength, high-precision, high-cadence, and long-duration data opens a new window into the time domain behavior of young stellar objects. Here we provide an overview of the observations, focusing on results from Spitzer and CoRoT. The highlight of this work is detailed analysis of 162 classical T Tauri stars for which we can probe optical and mid-infrared flux variations to 1% amplitudes and sub-hour timescales. We present a morphological variability census and then use metrics of periodicity, stochasticity, and symmetry to statistically separate the light curves into seven distinct classes, which we suggest represent different physical processes and geometric effects. We provide distributions of the characteristic timescales and amplitudes and assess the fractional representation within each class. The largest category (>20%) are optical "dippers" with discrete fading events lasting ~1-5 days. The degree of correlation between the optical and infrared light curves is positive but weak; notably, the independently assigned optical and infrared morphology classes tend to be different for the same object. Assessment of flux variation behavior with respect to (circum)stellar properties reveals correlations of variability parameters with Halpha emission and with effective temperature. Overall, our results point to multiple origins of young star variability, including circumstellar obscuration events, hot spots on the star and/or disk, accretion bursts, and rapid structural changes in the inner disk.  Based on data from the Spitzer and CoRoT missions. The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.},

@article{spi14a,
	Abstract = {Context. Recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters and star-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity. However, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous analyses. The Gaia-ESO Survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing large samples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, hence allowing us to further investigate this issue.  Aims: We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internal release of the Gaia-ESO Survey.  Methods: The 48 candidate members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the high-resolution, spectrograph UVES. We use the surface gravity, lithium line equivalent width, and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to confirm the cluster members, and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of the region.  Results: Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members. Considering the metallicity measurements for nine of them, we find that the iron abundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly subsolar with a mean value [Fe/H] = -0.08 $\pm$ 0.04 dex. This result agrees with the metallicity determination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the chemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more metal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this evidence may be related to the chemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby star-forming regions and young clusters.  Based on observations collected at the ESO telescopes under programme 188.B3002, the Gaia-ESO large public spectroscopic survey.Tables 1-3 are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Context. Chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters, but not in open clusters. Cluster mass seems to play a key role in the existence of multiple populations.  Aims: Studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters is needed to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determine the mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. Here we studied NGC 6705, which is a young and massive open cluster located towards the inner region of the Milky Way. This cluster is located inside the solar circle. This makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient.  Methods: This study makes use of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical isochrones to derive the age of NGC 6705. We study the density profile of the cluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of the chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of the red clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internal kinematics of the cluster.  Results: The estimated ages range from 250 to 316 Myr, depending on the adopted stellar model. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of mass segregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function and from the kinematics, finding values between 3700 M&sun; and 11 000 M&sun;. After selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities, we obtain a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.06 based on 21 candidate members. Moreover, NGC 6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations or anti-correlations between Al, Mg, Si, and Na, which are expected in multiple populations. This is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lower than the required mass limit proposed in the literature to develop multiple populations.

	Abstract = {Aims: Observational studies of the Milky Way bulge are providing increasing evidence of its complex chemo-dynamical patterns and morphology. Our intent is to use the iDR1 Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) data set to provide new constraints on the metallicity and kinematic trends of the Galactic bulge, exploring the viability of the currently proposed formation scenarios.  Methods: We analyzed the stellar parameters and radial velocities of ~1200 stars in five bulge fields wich are located in the region -10$\,^{\circ}$<l< 7$\,^{\circ}$ and -10$\,^{\circ}$<b< -4$\,^{\circ}$. We use VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) photometry to verify the internal consistency of the atmospheric parameters recommended by the consortium. As a by-product, we obtained reddening values using a semi-empirical Teff-color calibration. We constructed the metallicity distribution functions and combined them with photometric and radial velocity data to analyze the properties of the stellar populations in the observed fields.  Results: From a Gaussian decomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clear bimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of the specific position on the sky. In agreement with some previous studies, we find a mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b = -6$\,^{\circ}$ and b = -10$\,^{\circ}$) that arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poor components. The number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poor stars with increasing b. The K-magnitude distribution of the metal-rich population splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersects the near and far branches of the X-shaped bulge structure. In addition, two lateral fields at (l,b) = (7, -9) and (l,b) = (-10, -8) present contrasting characteristics. In the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated by metal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poor population and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. Finally, we find systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-rich and the metal-poor components of each field.  Conclusions: The iDR1 bulge data show chemo-dynamical distributions that are consistent with varying proportions of stars belonging to (i) a metal-rich boxy/peanut X-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics; and (ii) a metal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersion that dominates far from the Galactic plane. These first GES data already allow studying the detailed spatial dependence of the Galactic bulge populations, thanks to the analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.

	Abstract = {Context. The accretion process has a central role in the formation of stars and planets.  Aims: We aim at characterizing the accretion properties of several hundred members of the star-forming cluster NGC 2264 (3 Myr).  Methods: We performed a deep ugri mapping as well as a simultaneous u-band+r-band monitoring of the star-forming region with CFHT/MegaCam in order to directly probe the accretion process onto the star from UV excess measurements. Photometric properties and stellar parameters are determined homogeneously for about 750 monitored young objects, spanning the mass range ~0.1-2 M&sun;. About 40% of the sample are classical (accreting) T Tauri stars, based on various diagnostics (Halpha, UV and IR excesses). The remaining non-accreting members define the (photospheric + chromospheric) reference UV emission level over which flux excess is detected and measured.  Results: We revise the membership status of cluster members based on UV accretion signatures, and report a new population of 50 classical T Tauri star (CTTS) candidates. A large range of UV excess is measured for the CTTS population, varying from a few times 0.1 to ~3 mag. We convert these values to accretion luminosities and accretion rates, via a phenomenological description of the accretion shock emission. We thus obtain mass accretion rates ranging from a few 10-10 to ~10-7 M&sun;/yr. Taking into account a mass-dependent detection threshold for weakly accreting objects, we find a >6sigma correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar mass. A power-law fit, properly accounting for censored data (upper limits), yields Macc ∝ M*1.4$\pm$0.3. At any given stellar mass, we find a large spread of accretion rates, extending over about 2 orders of magnitude. The monitoring of the UV excess on a timescale of a couple of weeks indicates that its variability typically amounts to 0.5 dex, i.e., much smaller than the observed spread in accretion rates. We suggest that a non-negligible age spread across the star-forming region may effectively contribute to the observed spread in accretion rates at a given mass. In addition, different accretion mechanisms (like, e.g., short-lived accretion bursts vs. more stable funnel-flow accretion) may be associated to different Macc regimes.  Conclusions: A huge variety of accretion properties is observed for young stellar objects in the NGC 2264 cluster. While a definite correlation seems to hold between mass accretion rate and stellar mass over the mass range probed here, the origin of the large intrinsic spread observed in mass accretion rates at any given mass remains to be explored.

	Abstract = {Context. The ongoing Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is using FLAMES at the VLT to obtain high-quality medium-resolution Giraffe spectra for about 105 stars and high-resolution UVES spectra for about 5000 stars. With UVES, the Survey has already observed 1447 FGK-type stars.  Aims: These UVES spectra are analyzed in parallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to present how these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe how a final recommended parameter scale is defined. We also discuss the precision (method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to the reference values) of the final parameters. These results are part of the Gaia-ESO second internal release and will be part of its first public release of advanced data products.  Methods: The final parameter scale is tied to the scale defined by the Gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmospheric parameters. In addition, a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate the physical soundness of the results. Each of the implemented methodologies is judged against the benchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameter space. The final recommended results are the weighted medians of those from the individual methods.  Results: The recommended results successfully reproduce the atmospheric parameters of the benchmark stars and the expected Teff-log g relation of the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric parameters and abundances have been determined for 1301 FGK-type stars observed with UVES. The median of the method-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 K for Teff, 0.13 dex for log g and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases are estimated to be between 50-100 K for Teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g and 0.05-0.10 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd, and Eu. The typical method-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.  Conclusions: The Gaia-ESO sample of high-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars will be among the largest of its kind analyzed in a homogeneous way. The extensive list of elemental abundances derived in these stars will enable significant advances in the areas of stellar evolution and Milky Way formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {We performed a detailed study of the ratio of low-alpha to high-alpha stars in the Galactic halo as observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey. Using a sample of 381 metal-poor stars from the second internal data release, we found that the value of this ratio did not show evidence of systematic trends as a function of metallicity, surface gravity, Galactic latitude, Galactic longitude, height above the Galactic plane, and Galactocentric radius. We conclude that the alphapoor/alpharich value of 0.28 $\pm$ 0.08 suggests that in the inner halo, the larger portion of stars were formed in a high star formation rate environment, and about 15% of the metal-poor stars originated from much lower star formation rate environments.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey will observe a large sample of clusters and cluster stars, covering a wide age-distance-metallicity-position-density parameter space.  Aims: We aim to determine C, N, and O abundances in stars of Galactic open clusters of the Gaia-ESO survey and to compare the observed abundances with those predicted by current stellar and Galactic evolution models. In this pilot paper, we investigate the first three intermediate-age open clusters.  Methods: High-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO VLT, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances of carbon were derived using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 {\AA}. The wavelength interval 6470-6490 {\AA}, with CN features, was analysed to determine nitrogen abundances. Oxygen abundances were determined from the [O i] line at 6300 {\AA}.  Results: The mean values of the elemental abundances in Trumpler 20 as determined from 42 stars are: [ Fe/H ] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.08 (s.d.), [ C/H ] = -0.10 $\pm$ 0.07, [ N/H ] = 0.50 $\pm$ 0.07, and consequently C/N = 0.98 $\pm$ 0.12. We measure from five giants in NGC 4815: [ Fe/H ] = -0.01 $\pm$ 0.04, [ C/H ] = -0.17 $\pm$ 0.08, [ N/H ] = 0.53 $\pm$ 0.07, [ O/H ] = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.09, and C/N = 0.79 $\pm$ 0.08. We obtain from 27 giants in NGC 6705: [ Fe/H ] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.05, [ C/H ] = -0.08 $\pm$ 0.06, [ N/H ] = 0.61 $\pm$ 0.07, [ O/H ] = 0.13 $\pm$ 0.05, and C/N = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.19. The C/N ratios of stars in the investigated open clusters were compared with the ratios predicted by stellar evolutionary models. For the corresponding stellar turn-off masses from 1.9 to 3.3 M&sun;, the observed C/N ratio values are very close to the predictions of standard first dredge-up models as well as to models of thermohaline extra-mixing. They are not decreased as much as predicted by the recent model in which the thermohaline- and rotation-induced extra-mixing act together. The average [O/H] abundance ratios of NGC 4815 and NGC 6705 are compared with the predictions of two Galactic chemical evolution models. The data are consistent with the evolution at the solar radius within the errors.  Conclusions: The first results of CNO determinations in open clusters show the potential of the Gaia-ESO Survey to judge stellar and Galactic chemical evolution models and the validity of their physical assumptions through a homogeneous and detailed spectral analysis.  Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 188.B-3002 (The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey, PIs G. Gilmore and S. Randich).},

	Abstract = {Based on more than four weeks of continuous high-cadence photometric monitoring of several hundred members of the young cluster NGC 2264 with two space telescopes, NASA's Spitzer and the CNES CoRoT (Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits), we provide high-quality, multi-wavelength light curves for young stellar objects whose optical variability is dominated by short-duration flux bursts, which we infer are due to enhanced mass accretion rates. These light curves show many brief---several hours to one day---brightenings at optical and near-infrared wavelengths with amplitudes generally in the range of 5%-50% of the quiescent value. Typically, a dozen or more of these bursts occur in a 30 day period. We demonstrate that stars exhibiting this type of variability have large ultraviolet (UV) excesses and dominate the portion of the u - g versus g - r color-color diagram with the largest UV excesses. These stars also have large Halpha equivalent widths, and either centrally peaked, lumpy Halpha emission profiles or profiles with blueshifted absorption dips associated with disk or stellar winds. Light curves of this type have been predicted for stars whose accretion is dominated by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the boundary between their magnetosphere and inner circumstellar disk, or where magneto-rotational instabilities modulate the accretion rate from the inner disk. Among the stars with the largest UV excesses or largest Halpha equivalent widths, light curves with this type of variability greatly outnumber light curves with relatively smooth sinusoidal variations associated with long-lived hot spots. We provide quantitative statistics for the average duration and strength of the accretion bursts and for the fraction of the accretion luminosity associated with these bursts.  Based on data from the Spitzer and CoRoT missions, as well as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam CCD, and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal Chile, under program 088.C-0239. The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain. MegaCam is a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {According to our current cosmological model, galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience many mergers over their lifetimes. The most massive of the merging galaxies will be dragged towards the disc plane, depositing stars and dark matter into an accreted disc structure. In this work, we utilize the chemodynamical template developed in Ruchti et al. to hunt for accreted stars. We apply the template to a sample of 4675 stars in the third internal data release from the Gaia-ESO Spectroscopic Survey. We find a significant component of accreted halo stars, but find no evidence of an accreted disc component. This suggests that the Milky Way has had a rather quiescent merger history since its disc formed some 8-10 billion years ago and therefore possesses no significant dark matter disc.},

We describe the discovery and analysis of four bulge giants with -2.72 <= [Fe/H] <= -2.48, the lowest metallicity bulge stars studied with high-resolution spectroscopy to date. Using FLAMES/UVES spectra through the Gaia-ESO Survey we have derived abundances of twelve elements. Given the uncertainties, we find a chemical similarity between these bulge stars and halo stars of the same metallicity, although the abundance scatter may be larger, with some of the stars showing unusual [alpha/Fe] ratios.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Until recently, most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the Galactic thin and thick discs were mostly confined to objects in the solar vicinity. Here we aim at enlarging the volume in which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise the thin and thick discs, using the first internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES iDR1).  Methods: We used the spectra of around 2000 FGK dwarfs and giants from the GES iDR1, obtained at resolutions of up to R ~ 20 000 with the FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph. We derive and discuss the abundances of eight elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cr, Ni, and Y).  Results: We show that the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar to those in the solar neighbourhood. We find a natural division between alpha-rich and alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [Mg/M] distributions in bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences, respectively. This separation is visible for most alpha-elements and for aluminium. With the possible exception of Al, the observed dispersion around the trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room for astrophysical dispersion. Using previously derived distances from the first paper from this series for our sample, we further find that the thick-disc is more extended vertically and is more centrally concentrated towards the inner Galaxy than the thin-disc, which indicates a shorter scale-length. We derive the radial (4 to 12 kpc) and vertical (0 to 3.5 kpc) gradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and aluminium for the two populations, taking into account the identified correlation between RGC and | Z |. Similarly to other works, a radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. The positive radial individual [alpha/M] gradients found are at variance from the gradients observed in the RAVE survey. The thin disc also hosts a negative vertical metallicity gradient in the solar cylinder, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/M] and [Al/M] gradients. The thick-disc, on the other hand, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallower vertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-iron radial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positive vertical individual [alpha/M] and [Al/M] gradients. We examine several thick-disc formation scenarii in the light of these radial and vertical trends.  Based on observations collected at ESO telescopes under Gaia-ESO survey programme.Full Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/572/A33},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study how diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured toward distance-distributed target stars can be used to locate dense interstellar (IS) clouds in the Galaxy and probe a line-of-sight (LOS) kinematical structure, a potentially useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or not available in the spectral range. Cool target stars are numerous enough for this purpose.  Methods: We devised automated DIB-fitting methods appropriate for cool star spectra and multiple IS components. The data were fitted with a combination of a synthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empirical DIB profiles. The initial number of DIB components and their radial velocity were guided by HI 21 cm emission spectra, or, when available in the spectral range, IS neutral sodium absorption lines. For NaI, radial velocities of NaI lines and DIBs were maintained linked during a global simultaneous fit. In parallel, stellar distances and extinctions were estimated self-consistently by means of a 2D Bayesian method from spectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data.  Results: We have analyzed Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) spectra of 225 stars that probe between ~2 and 10 kpc long LOS in five different regions of the Milky Way. The targets are the two CoRoT fields, two open clusters (NGC 4815 and gamma Vel), and the Galactic bulge. Two OGLE fields toward the bulge observed before the GES are also included (205 target stars). Depending on the observed spectral intervals, we extracted one or more of the following DIBs: lambdalambda 6283.8, 6613.6, and 8620.4. For each field, we compared the DIB strengths with the Bayesian distances and extinctions, and the DIB Doppler velocities with the HI emission spectra.  Conclusions: For all fields, the DIB strength and the target extinction are well correlated. For targets that are widely distributed in distance, marked steps in DIBs and extinction radial distance profiles match each other and broadly correspond to the expected locations of spiral arms. For all fields, the DIB velocity structure agrees with HI emission spectra, and all detected DIBs correspond to strong NaI lines. This illustrates how DIBs can be used to locate the Galactic interstellar gas and to study its kinematics at the kpc scale, as illustrated by Local and Perseus Arm DIBs that differ by ≳30 km s-1, in agreement with HI emission spectra. On the other hand, if most targets are located beyond the main absorber, DIBs can trace the differential reddening within the field.

	Abstract = {The Gaia-ESO survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed at investigating the origin and formation history of our Galaxy by collecting spectroscopy of representative samples (about 105 Milky Way stars) of all Galactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. The survey uses globular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars in clusters, along with radial velocity determinations. We used precise radial velocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 4372, NGC 4833, NGC 5927, NGC 6752, and NGC 7078) to validate pipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internal kinematics. Radial velocity measurements were extracted from FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal data release of data products to ESO. We complemented our sample with ESO archival data obtained with different instrument configurations. Reliable radial velocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained in total. We measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions, and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters, providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of the central velocitydispersion for the cluster NGC 5927. Finally, we explore the possible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. The analysis we present here demonstrates that Gaia-ESO survey data are sufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systems and stellar populations in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {The nearby (distance ~ 350-400 pc), rich Vela OB2 association, includes gamma2 Velorum, one of the most massive binaries in the solar neighbourhood and an excellent laboratory for investigating the formation and early evolution of young clusters. Recent Gaia-ESO survey observations have led to the discovery of two kinematically distinct populations in the young (10-15 Myr) cluster immediately surrounding gamma2 Velorum. Here we analyse the results of Gaia-ESO survey observations of NGC 2547, a 35 Myr cluster located two degrees south of gamma2 Velorum. The radial velocity distribution of lithium-rich pre-main sequence stars shows a secondary population that is kinematically distinct from and younger than NGC 2547. The radial velocities, lithium absorption lines, and the positions in a colour-magnitude diagram of this secondary population are consistent with those of one of the components discovered around gamma2 Velorum. This result shows that there is a young, low-mass stellar population spread over at least several square degrees in the Vela OB2 association. This population could have originally been part of a cluster around gamma2 Velorum that expanded after gas expulsion or formed in a less dense environment that is spread over the whole Vela OB2 region.

	Abstract = {Aims: One of the goals of the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES), which is conducted with FLAMES at the VLT, is the census and the characterization of the low-mass members of very young clusters and associations. We conduct a comparative study of the main properties of the sources belonging to gamma Velorum (gamma Vel) and Chamaeleon I (Cha I) young associations, focusing on their rotation, chromospheric radiative losses, and accretion.  Methods: We used the fundamental parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, lithium abundance, and radial velocity) delivered by the GES consortium in the first internal data release to select the members of gamma Vel and Cha I among the UVES and GIRAFFE spectroscopic observations. A total of 140 gamma Vel members and 74 Cha I members were studied. The procedure adopted by the GES to derive stellar fundamental parameters also provided measures of the projected rotational velocity (vsini). We calculated stellar luminosities through spectral energy distributions, while stellar masses were derived by comparison with evolutionary tracks. The spectral subtraction of low-activity and slowly rotating templates, which are rotationally broadened to match the vsini of the targets, enabled us to measure the equivalent widths (EWs) and the fluxes in the Halpha and Hbeta lines. The Halpha line was also used for identifying accreting objects, on the basis of its EW and the width at the 10% of the line peak (10%W), and for evaluating the mass accretion rate (Macc).  Results: The distribution of vsini for the members of gamma Vel displays a peak at about 10 km s-1 with a tail toward faster rotators. There is also some indication of a different vsini distribution for the members of its two kinematical populations. Most of these stars have Halpha fluxes corresponding to a saturated activity regime. We find a similar distribution, but with a narrower peak, for Cha I. Only a handful of stars in gamma Vel display signatures of accretion, while many more accretors were detected in the younger Cha I, where the highest Halpha fluxes are mostly due to accretion, rather than to chromospheric activity. Accreting and active stars occupy two different regions in a Teff-flux diagram and we propose a criterion for distinguishing them. We derive Macc in the ranges 10-11-10-9 M&sun; yr-1 and 10-10-10-7 M&sun; yr-1 for gamma Vel and Cha I accretors, respectively. We find less scatter in the Macc - M* relation derived through the Halpha EWs, when compared to the Halpha10%W diagnostics, in agreement with other authors.

	Abstract = {Context. The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopy of some 100 000 Milky Way stars using the FLAMES spectrograph at the VLT, down to V = 19 mag, systematically covering all the main components of the Milky Way and providing the first homogeneous overview of the distributions of kinematics and chemical element abundances in the Galaxy. Observations of young open clusters, in particular, are giving new insights into their initial structure, kinematics, and their subsequent evolution.  Aims: This paper describes the analysis of UVES and GIRAFFE spectra acquired in the fields of young clusters whose population includes pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. The analysis is applied to all stars in such fields, regardless of any prior information on membership, and provides fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters, elemental abundances, and PMS-specific parameters such as veiling, accretion, and chromospheric activity.  Methods: When feasible, different methods were used to derive raw parameters (e.g. line equivalent widths) fundamental atmospheric parameters and derived parameters (e.g. abundances). To derive some of these parameters, we used methods that have been extensively used in the past and new ones developed in the context of the Gaia-ESO survey enterprise. The internal precision of these quantities was estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by these different methods, while the accuracy was estimated by comparison with independent external data, such as effective temperature and surface gravity derived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars. A validation procedure based on these comparisons was applied to discard spurious or doubtful results and produce recommended parameters. Specific strategies were implemented to resolve problems of fast rotation, accretion signatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling.  Results: The analysis carried out on spectra acquired in young cluster fields during the first 18 months of observations, up to June 2013, is presented in preparation of the first release of advanced data products. These include targets in the fields of the rho Oph, Cha I, NGC 2264, gamma Vel, and NGC 2547 clusters. Stellar parameters obtained with the higher resolution and larger wavelength coverage from UVES are reproduced with comparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lower resolution of the GIRAFFE setup adopted for young stars, which allows us to provide stellar parameters with confidence for the much larger GIRAFFE sample. Precisions are estimated to be ≈120 K rms in Teff, ≈0.3 dex rms in log g, and ≈0.15 dex rms in [Fe/H] for the UVES and GIRAFFE setups.},

@article{mcg15a,
	Abstract = {Context. The classical T Tauri star (CTTS) AA Tau has presented photometric variability that was attributed to an inner disk warp, caused by the interaction between the inner disk and an inclined magnetosphere. Previous studies of the young cluster NGC 2264 have shown that similar photometric behavior is common among CTTS.  Aims: The goal of this work is to investigate the main causes of the observed photometric variability of CTTS in NGC 2264 that present AA Tau-like light curves, and verify if an inner disk warp could be responsible for their observed variability.  Methods: In order to understand the mechanism causing these stars' photometric behavior, we investigate veiling variability in their spectra and u - r color variations and estimate parameters of the inner disk warp using an occultation model proposed for AA Tau. We also compare infrared Spitzer IRAC and optical CoRoT light curves to analyze the dust responsible for the occultations.  Results: AA Tau-like variability proved to be transient on a timescale of a few years. We ascribe this variability to stable accretion regimes and aperiodic variability to unstable accretion regimes and show that a transition, and even coexistence, between the two is common. We find evidence of hot spots associated with occultations, indicating that the occulting structures could be located at the base of accretion columns. We find average values of warp maximum height of 0.23 times its radial location, consistent with AA Tau, with variations of on average 11% between rotation cycles. We also show that extinction laws in the inner disk indicate the presence of grains larger than interstellar grains.  Conclusions: The inner disk warp scenario is consistent with observations for all but one star with AA Tau-like variability in our sample. AA Tau-like systems are fairly common, comprising 14% of CTTS observed in NGC 2264, though this number increases to 35% among systems of mass 0.7 M&sun; ≲ M ≲ 2.0 M&sun;. Assuming random inclinations, we estimate that nearly all systems in this mass range likely possess an inner disk warp. We attribute this to a possible change in magnetic field configurations among stars of lower mass.  Based on data from the Spitzer and CoRoT missions, as well as the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam CCD, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope, and the US Naval Observatory. The CoRoT space mission was developed and operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.

The repeating photometric dips have FWHMs generally less than 1 day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3 < P < 11 days) consistent with dust near the Keplerian co-rotation period. The flux dips vary considerably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist for several weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected in successive years. For several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotation period and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted by standard ``disk-locking'' models. We attribute these flux dips to clumps of material in or near the inner disk wall, passing through our line of sight to the stellar photosphere. In some cases, these dips are also present in simultaneous Spitzer IRAC light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We characterize the properties of these dips, and compare the stars with light curves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of YSOs in NGC 2264. A number of physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near the inner disk wall, and we discuss several of those mechanisms; the most plausible mechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magnetic field or dust entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the inner disk wall.  Based on data from the Spitzer and CoRoT missions, as well as the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam CCD, and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal Chile, under program 088.C-0239. The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain. MegaCam is a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {Context. Large spectroscopic surveys have in recent years enabled computing three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to the accurate stellar atmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances these surveys provide. Interstellar extinction maps are complementary to 3D maps extracted from photometry and allow a more thorough studying of the dust properties.  Aims: Our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic survey Gaia-ESO to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellar extinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and the Galactocentric position.  Methods: We used the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than 5000 stars, obtained from the Gaia-ESO survey second internal data release, and combined them with optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (VISTA) photometry as well as different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones to calculate line-of-sight extinction and distances. The extinction coefficients were then compared with the literature to discuss their dependency on the stellar parameters and position in the Galaxy.  Results: Within the errors of our method, our work does not show any dependence of the interstellar extinction coefficient on the stellar atmospheric parameters. We find no evidence of a variation of E(J - H) /E(J - K) with the angle from the Galactic centre or with Galactocentric distance. This suggests that we are dealing with a uniform extinction law in the SDSS ugriz bands and the near-IR JHKs bands. Therefore, extinction maps built from mean colour-excesses that assume a constant extinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

	Abstract = {Aims.We observed brown dwarfs in different evolutionary stages with the Chandra X-ray Observatory with the aim to disentangle the influence of different stellar parameters on the X-ray emission of substellar objects. The ages of our three targets (HR 7329 B, Gl 569 Bab, and HD 130948 BC) are constrained by them being companions to main-sequence stars of known age. With both known age and effective temperature or bolometric luminosity, the mass can be derived from evolutionary models. Methods.Combining the new observations with previous studies presented in the literature yields a brown dwarf sample that covers the age range from ~1 Myr to ~1 Gyr. Since the atmospheric temperature of brown dwarfs is approximately constant at young ages, a sample with a large age spread is essential for investigating the possible influence of effective temperature on X-ray activity. Results.Two out of three brown dwarfs are detected with Chandra, with variable lightcurves and comparatively soft spectra. Combining our results with published data allows us to consider a subsample of high-mass brown dwarfs (with 0.05-0.07 M_&sun;), thus eliminating mass from the list of free parameters. We find evidence that X-ray luminosity declines with decreasing bolometric luminosity steeper than expected from the canonical relation for late-type stars (L_x/L_bol = 10-3...-5). Effective temperature is identified as a likely parameter responsible for the additional decline of X-ray activity in the more evolved (and therefore cooler) brown dwarfs of the "high-mass" sample. In another subsample of brown dwarfs characterized by similar effective temperature, the X-ray luminosity scales with the bolometric luminosity without indications for a deviation from the canonical range of 10-3...-5 observed for late-type stars.Conclusions.Our findings support the idea that effective temperature plays a critical role for the X-ray activity in brown dwarfs. This underlines an earlier suggestion based on observations of chromospheric Halpha emission in ultracool dwarfs that the low ionization fraction in the cool brown dwarf atmospheres may suppress magnetic activity.},

	Abstract = {We analyze six ROSAT HRI observations pointed toward the Star Forming Region (SFR) NGC 2264. Three are pointed to the southern star formation core, the other three about 20' to the north. We detect 169 X-ray sources, ~ 95% of which are likely to be Pre Main Sequence (PMS) stars, significantly enlarging the known population of the SFR in the area covered by the observations. Using published BVRI photometry we place the X-ray sources with well defined optical counterparts on the HRI diagram and estimate their masses and ages. Our comparison of the mass function and age distribution of the X-ray sources with results previously obtained for NGC 2264, demonstrates that deep X-ray observations provide, at least in this case, a very efficient method of selecting SFR members and does not introduce stronger biases than other methods. Since the observation cover a time span of ~ 5 years, we are able to study in detail the X-ray variability of our sample of PMS stars. We find that: 1) a large fraction of our sources are variable on several time scales and 2) Classical T Tauri Systems (i.e. stars surrounded by disks) are significantly more variable than the rest of our sample, suggesting a role of accretion disks in the emission and/or in the absorption of the X-ray radiation.},

	Abstract = {The pre-main sequence (PMS) population in the mass range between ~ 0.2 and ~ 3 M_sun in southern part of the star-forming region NGC 2264 has been studied, determining both the Initial Mass Function in the region as well as the star-formation rates for different mass ranges. The sample is a composite one, derived through the union of samples obtained through different techniques and each suffering from different biases: previously known PMS stars in the region from the literature, photometrically-selected T Tauri candidates (from our own photometric data, discussed in detail in the present paper) and X-ray selected PMS candidates (discussed in detail in a companion paper) have been joined to form a sample which we show to be statistically complete (i.e. free from the biases which affect each of the parent samples) down to =~ 0.6 M_sun (while being incomplete at lower masses). Individual masses and ages have been derived by placing the individual stars on evolutionary tracks, allowing us to derive both the IMF and the star formation rate. The Initial Mass Function thus derived for NGC 2264 shows evidence for a bimodal distribution of masses, with a break in the IMF at around 1 M_sun. Based on observations with the VATT: the Alice P.

	Abstract = {We present new VLT/X-Shooter optical and NIR spectra of a sample of 17 candidate young low-mass stars and BDs in the rho-Ophiucus cluster. We derived SpT and Av for all the targets, and then we determined their physical parameters. All the objects but one have M*<0.6 Msun, and 8 have mass below or close to the hydrogen-burning limit. Using the intensity of various emission lines present in their spectra, we determined the Lacc and Macc for all the objects. When compared with previous works targeting the same sample, we find that, in general, these objects are not as strongly accreting as previously reported, and we suggest that the reason is our more accurate estimate of the photospheric parameters. We also compare our findings with recent works in other slightly older star-forming regions to investigate possible differences in the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for our targets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as in the other regions. This leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for a different dependence of Macc with M* when comparing low-mass stars and BDs. Moreover, we find a similar small (1 dex) scatter in the Macc-M* relation as in some of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significant differences in Macc due to different ages or properties of the regions. The latter result suffers, however, from low statistics and sample selection biases in the current studies. The small scatter in the Macc-M* correlation confirms that Macc in the literature based on uncertain photospheric parameters and single accretion indicators, such as the Ha width, can lead to a scatter that is unphysically large. Our studies show that only broadband spectroscopic surveys coupled with a detailed analysis of the photospheric and accretion properties allows us to properly study the evolution of disk accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {Using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea, we have carried out a new near-infrared J, H, K monitoring survey of almost a square degree of the star-forming Orion Nebula Cluster with observations on 120 nights over three observing seasons, spanning a total of 894 days. We monitored ~15,000 stars down to J=20 using the WFCAM instrument, and have extracted 1203 significantly variable stars from our data. By studying variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) in the H-K, K color-magnitude diagram, we are able to distinguish between physical mechanisms of variability. Many variables show color behavior indicating either dust-extinction or disk/accretion activity, but we find that when monitored for longer periods of time, a number of stars shift between these two variability mechanisms. Further, we show that the intrinsic timescale of disk/accretion variability in young stars is longer than that of dust-extinction variability. We confirm that variability amplitude is statistically correlated with evolutionary class in all bands and colors. Our investigations of these 1203 variables have revealed 73 periodic AA Tau type variables, many large-amplitude and long-period (P > 15 day) YSOs, including three stars showing widely-spaced periodic brightening events consistent with circumbinary disk activity, and four new eclipsing binaries. These phenomena and others indicate the activity of long-term disk/accretion variability processes taking place in young stars. We have made the light curves and associated data for these 1203 variables available online.},

	Abstract = {Aims. We study the X-ray emission of low-mass main-sequence stars to derive a reliable general scaling law between coronal temperature and the level of X-ray activity. Methods. We collect ROSAT measurements of hardness ratios and X-ray luminosities for a large sample of stars to derive which stellar X-ray emission parameter is most closely correlated with coronal temperature. We calculate average coronal temperatures for a sample of 24 low-mass main-sequence stars with measured emission measure distributions (EMDs) collected from the literature. These EMDs are based on high-resolution X-ray spectra measured by XMM-Newton and Chandra. Results. We confirm that there is one universal scaling relation between coronal average temperature and surface X-ray flux, Fx, that applies to all low-mass main-sequence stars. We find that coronal temperature is related to Fx by Tcor=0.11 Fx^0.26, where Tcor is in MK and Fx is in erg/s/cm^2.},

	Abstract = {The atmospheric structure of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and its connection with the large-scale outflow is poorly known. Neither the effect of the magnetically mediated interaction between the star and the disc is well understood. The Mg II multiplet is a fundamental tracer of TTSs atmospheres and outflows, and is the strongest feature in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of TTSs. The International Ultraviolet Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope data archives provide a unique set to study the main physical compounds contributing to the line profile and to derive the properties of the line formation region. The Mg II profiles of 44 TTSs with resolution 13 000-30 000 are available in these archives. In this work, we use this data set to measure the main observables: flux, broadening, asymmetry, terminal velocity of the outflow, and the velocity of the discrete absorption components. For some few sources repeated observations are available and variability has been studied. There is a warm wind that at sub-au scales absorbs the blue wing of the Mg II profiles. The main result found in this work is the correlation between the line broadening, Mg II flux, terminal velocity of the flow and accretion rate. Both outflow and magnetospheric plasma contribute to the Mg II flux. The flux-flux correlation between Mg II and C IV or He II is confirmed; however, no correlation is found between the Mg II flux and the UV continuum or the H2 emission.},

@article{sur15a,
	Abstract = {Theoretical simulations and observations at different angular resolutions have shown that magnetic fields have a central role in massive star formation. Like in low-mass star formation, the magnetic field in massive young stellar objects can either be oriented along the outflow axis or randomly. Measuring the magnetic field at milliarcsecond resolution (10-100 au) around a substantial number of massive young stellar objects permits determining with a high statistical significance whether the direction of the magnetic field is correlated with the orientation of the outflow axis or not. In late 2012, we started a large VLBI campaign with the European VLBI Network to measure the linearly and circularly polarized emission of 6.7 GHz methanol masers around a sample of massive star-forming regions. This paper focuses on the first seven observed sources, G24.78+0.08, G25.65+1.05, G29.86-0.04, G35.03+0.35, G37.43+1.51, G174.20-0.08, and G213.70-12.6. For all these sources, molecular outflows have been detected in the past. We detected a total of 176 methanol masing cloudlets toward the seven massive star-forming regions, 19% of which show linearly polarized emission. The methanol masers around the massive young stellar object MM1 in G174.20-0.08 show neither linearly nor circularly polarized emission. The linear polarization vectors are well ordered in all the other massive young stellar objects. We measured significant Zeeman splitting toward both A1 and A2 in G24.78+0.08, and toward G29.86-0.04 and G213.70-12.6. By considering all the 19 massive young stellar objects reported in the literature for which both the orientation of the magnetic field at milliarcsecond resolution and the orientation of outflow axes are known, we find evidence that the magnetic field (on scales 10-100 au) is preferentially oriented along the outflow axes.},

	Abstract = {We report upper limits to the radio and X-ray emission from the newly discovered ultracool dwarf binary WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1 (Luhman 16AB). As the nearest ultracool dwarf binary (2 pc), its proximity offers a hefty advantage to studying plasma processes in ultracool dwarfs which are more similar in gross properties (radius, mass, temperature) to the solar system giant planets than stars. The radio and X-ray emission upper limits from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and Chandra observations, each spanning multiple rotation periods, provide the deepest fractional radio and X-ray luminosities to date on an ultracool dwarf, with $\log{(L_{\rm r,\nu}/L_{\rm bol}) [Hz^{-1}]} < -18.1$ (5.5 GHz), $\log{(L_{\rm r,\nu}/L_{\rm bol}) [Hz^{-1}]} < -17.9$ (9 GHz), and $\log{(L_{\rm x}/L_{\rm bol})} < -5.7$. While the radio upper limits alone do not allow for a constraint on the magnetic field strength, we limit the size of any coherently emitting region in our line of sight to less than 0.2\% of the radius of one of the brown dwarfs. Any source of incoherent emission must span less than about 20\% of the brown dwarf radius, assuming magnetic field strengths of a few tens to a few hundred Gauss. The fast rotation and large amplitude photometric variability exhibited by the T dwarf in the Luhman 16AB system are not accompanied by enhanced nonthermal radio emission, nor enhanced heating to coronal temperatures, as observed on some higher mass ultracool dwarfs, confirming the expected decoupling of matter and magnetic field in cool neutral atmospheres.},

	Abstract = {We aim at determining the spatial distribution of the gas and dust in star-forming regions and address their relative abundances in quantitative terms. We also examine the dust opacity exponent beta for spatial and/or temporal variations. Using mapping observations of the very dense rho Oph A core, we examined standard 1D and non-standard 3D methods to analyse data of far-infrared and submillimeter (submm) continuum radiation. The resulting dust surface density distribution can be compared to that of the gas. The latter was derived from the analysis of accompanying molecular line emission, observed with Herschel from space and with APEX from the ground. As a gas tracer we used N2H+, which is believed to be much less sensitive to freeze-out than CO and its isotopologues. Radiative transfer modelling of the N2H+(J=3-2) and (J=6-5) lines with their hyperfine structure explicitly taken into account provides solutions for the spatial distribution of the column density N(H2), hence the surface density distribution of the gas. The gas-to-dust mass ratio is varying across the map, with very low values in the central regions around the core SM 1. The global average, =88, is not far from the canonical value of 100, however. In rho Oph A, the exponent beta of the power-law description for the dust opacity exhibits a clear dependence on time, with high values of 2 for the envelope-dominated emission in starless Class -1 sources to low values close to 0 for the disk-dominated emission in Class III objects. beta assumes intermediate values for evolutionary classes in between. Since beta is primarily controlled by grain size, grain growth mostly occurs in circumstellar disks. The spatial segregation of gas and dust, seen in projection toward the core centre, probably implies that, like C18O, also N2H+ is frozen onto the grains.},

	Abstract = {We present 850 micron observations of the 2-3 Myr cluster IC 348 in the Perseus molecular cloud using the SCUBA-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our SCUBA-2 map has a diameter of 30 arcmin and contains ~370 cluster members, including ~200 objects with IR excesses. We detect a total of 13 discs. Assuming standard dust properties and a gas to dust mass ratio of 100, we derive disc masses ranging from 1.5 to 16 M_JUP . We also detect 8 Class 0/I protostars. We find that the most massive discs (M_Disc > 3 MJUP ; 850 micron fux > 10 mJy) in IC 348 tend to be transition objects according to the characteristic "dip" in their infrared Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). This trend is also seen in other regions. We speculate that this could be an initial conditions effect (e.g., more massive discs tend to form giant planets that result in transition disc SEDs) and/or a disc evolution effect (the formation of one or more massive planets results in both a transition disc SED and a reduction of the accretion rate, increasing the lifetime of the outer disc). A stacking analysis of the discs that remain undetected in our SCUBA-2 observations suggests that their median 850 micron flux should be ~1 mJy, corresponding to a disc mass ~0.3 M_JUP (gas plus dust) or ~1 M_Earth of dust. While the available data are not deep enough to allow a meaningful comparison of the disc luminosity functions between IC 348 and other young stellar clusters, our results imply that disc masses exceeding the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula are very rare (~1%) at the age of IC 348, specially around very low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Submillimeter Array to image, at ~1.5" resolution, C2H (3-2) emission from the circumstellar disk orbiting the nearby (D = 54 pc), ~8 Myr-old, ~0.8 Msun classical T Tauri star TW Hya. The SMA imaging reveals that the C2H emission exhibits a ring-like morphology. Based on a model in which the C2H column density follows a truncated radial power-law distribution, we find that the inner edge of the ring lies at ~45 AU, and that the ring extends to at least ~120 AU. Comparison with previous (single-dish) observations of C2H (4-3) emission indicates that the C2H molecules are subthermally excited and, hence, that the emission arises from the relatively warm, tenuous upper atmosphere of the disk. We propose that the C2H emission most likely traces particularly efficient photo-destruction of small grains and/or photodesorption and photodissociation of hydrocarbons derived from grain ice mantles in the surface layers of the outer disk. The presence of a C2H ring in the TW Hya disk hence likely serves as a marker of dust grain processing and radial and vertical grain size segregation within the disk.},

By comparing them through a Bayesian method with low mass stars ($0.8\lesssim$ M/M$_\odot\lesssim0.1$) from previous works in the 25 Orionis group, we found statistically significant differences in the number fraction of classical T Tauri stars, weak T Tauri stars, class II, evolved discs and purely photospheric emitters at both sides of the sub-stellar mass limit. Particularly we found a fraction of $3.9^{+2.4}_{-1.6}~\%$ low mass stars classified as CTTS and class II or evolved discs, against a fraction of $33.3^{+10.8}_{-9.8}~\%$ in the sub-stellar mass domain. Our results support the suggested scenario in which the dissipation of discs is less efficient for decreasing mass of the central object.},

@article{har15a,
	Abstract = {The evolution of a circumstellar disk from its gas-rich protoplanetary to gas-poor debris stage is not well understood. It is apparent that disk-clearing progresses from the inside-out on a short time-scale, and photoevaporation models are frequently invoked to explain this process. However, the photoevaporation rates predicted by recent models differ by up to two orders of magnitude, resulting in uncertain time-scales for the final stages of disk clearing. The best candidates for studying this stage are weak line T Tauri stars (WTTS) with significant IR excess. We here aim to provide observational constraints on theories of disk-clearing by measuring the dust masses and CO content of a sample of such WTTS. We use ALMA band-6 to obtain continuum and $^{12}$CO(2-1) line fluxes for a sample of 24 WTTS stars with a known IR-excess. For these systems, we infer the dust mass from the continuum observations, and derive disk luminosities and ages to allow comparison with previously detected systems. We detect continuum emission in only 4 of 24 systems, and no $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission in any. For those systems without a continuum detection, the dust mass and fractional disk luminosity upper-limits suggest they are in the debris disk regime, making them some of the youngest debris disks known. Of those with a continuum detection, three are possible photoevaporating disks but photodissociation has likely reduced the CO abundance to below our detection limit. The low fraction of continuum detections implies that once accretion onto the star stops, the clearing of the majority of dust progresses very rapidly. Most WTTS with IR excess are not in transition but resemble debris disks. The dust in these disks is either primordial and survived the disk clearing, or is of second generation origin. In the latter case, the presence of giant planets within these systems might be the cause.},

	Abstract = {Planet formation is one explanation for the partial clearing of dust observed in the disks of some T Tauri stars. Indeed studies using state-of-the-art high angular resolution techniques have very recently begun to observe planetary companions in these so-called transitional disks. The goal of this work is to use spectra of the transitional disk object LkCa 15 obtained with X-Shooter on the Very Large Telescope to investigate the possibility of using spectro-astrometry to detect planetary companions to T Tauri stars. It is argued that an accreting planet should contribute to the total emission of accretion tracers such as H$\alpha$ and therefore planetary companions could be detected with spectro-astrometry in the same way as it has been used to detect stellar companions to young stars. A probable planetary-mass companion was recently detected in the disk of LkCa 15. Therefore, it is an ideal target for this pilot study. We studied several key accretion lines in the wavelength range 300 nm to 2.2 $\mu$m with spectro-astrometry. While no spectro-astrometric signal is measured for any emission lines the accuracy achieved in the technique is used to place an upper limit on the contribution of the planet to the flux of the H$\alpha$, Pa$\gamma$, and Pa$\beta$ lines. The derived upper limits on the flux allows an upper limit of the mass accretion rate, log($\dot{M}_{acc}$) = -8.9 to -9.3 for the mass of the companion between 6 M$_{Jup}$ and 15 M$_{Jup}$, respectively, to be estimated (with some assumptions).},

	Abstract = {ISO-Oph-50 is a young low-mass object in the ~Myr old Ophiuchus star forming region undergoing dramatic changes in its optical/near/mid-infrared brightness by 2-4 mag. We present new multi-band photometry and near-infrared spectra, combined with a synopsis of the existing literature data. Based on the spectroscopy, the source is confirmed as a mid M dwarf, with evidence for ongoing accretion. The near-infrared lightcurves show large-scale variations, with 2-4 mag amplitude in the bands IJHK, with the object generally being bluer when faint. Near its brightest state, the object shows colour changes consistent with variable extinction of dAV~7 mag. High-cadence monitoring at 3.6mu reveals quasi-periodic variations with a typical timescale of 1-2 weeks. The best explanation for these characteristics is a low-mass star seen through circumstellar matter, whose complex variability is caused by changing inhomogeneities in the inner parts of the disk. When faint, the direct stellar emission is blocked; the near-infrared radiation is dominated by scattered light. When bright, the emission is consistent with a photosphere strongly reddened by circumstellar dust. Based on the available constraints, the inhomogeneities have to be located at or beyond ~0.1 AU distance from the star. If this scenario turns out to be correct, a major portion of the inner disk has to be clumpy, structured, and/or in turmoil. In its observational characteristics, this object resembles other types of YSOs with variability caused in the inner disk. Compared to other objects, however, ISO-Oph-50 is clearly an extreme case, given the large amplitude of the brightness and colour changes combined with the erratic behaviour. ISO-Oph-50 has been near its brightest state since 2013; further monitoring is highly encouraged.},

	Abstract = {The Gaia-ESO Survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature of the Gamma Velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematically distinct populations (hereafter, population A and B), showing two different velocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (RV) shift. In this paper, we propose that the two populations of the Gamma Velorum cluster originate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecular cloud. We investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation N-body simulations. Our scenario is able to reproduce not only the RV shift and the different velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), the different spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5 pc) of the two populations. The observed 1-2 Myr age difference between the two populations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the two sub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. Our simulations suggest that population B is strongly supervirial, while population A is close to virial equilibrium. We discuss the implications of our models for the formation of young star clusters and OB associations in the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Two different mechanisms may act to induce quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in whole-disk observations of stellar flares. One mechanism may be magneto-hydromagnetic (MHD) forces and other processes acting on flare loops as seen in the Sun. The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as `sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyze short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in 75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 percent of stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly-damped global oscillation because the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles (QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare. However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analyzed the amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two delta Scuti stars and one gamma Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations (starquakes).},

	Abstract = {We analyze 3 epochs of ultraviolet (UV), optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Taurus transitional disk GM Aur using the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX spectrograph. Observations were separated by one week and 3 months in order to study variability over multiple timescales. We calculate accretion rates for each epoch of observations using the STIS spectra and find that those separated by one week had similar accretion rates (~1E-8 solar masses/yr) while the epoch obtained 3 months later had a substantially lower accretion rate (~4E-9 solar masses/yr). We find that the decline in accretion rate is caused by lower densities of material in the accretion flows, as opposed to a lower surface coverage of the accretion columns. During the low accretion rate epoch we also observe lower fluxes at both far UV (FUV) and IR wavelengths, which trace molecular gas and dust in the disk, respectively. We find that this can be explained by a lower dust and gas mass in the inner disk. We attribute the observed variability to inhomogeneities in the inner disk, near the corotation radius, where gas and dust may co-exist near the footprints of the magnetospheric flows. These FUV--NIR data offer a new perspective on the structure of the inner disk, the stellar magnetosphere, and their interaction.},

	Abstract = {We present the latest development of the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model, originally introduced by us to explain episodic accretion bursts in the early stages of star formation. Using our numerical hydrodynamics model with improved disk thermal balance and star-disk interaction, we computed the evolution of protostellar disks formed from the gravitational collapse of prestellar cores. In agreement with our previous studies, we find that cores of higher initial mass and angular momentum produce disks that are more favorable to gravitational instability and fragmentation, while a higher background irradiation and magnetic fields moderate the disk tendency to fragment. The protostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear interaction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable disk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star owing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms. Most bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction taking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in the optically visible Class II phase. The average burst duration and mean luminosity are found to be in good agreement with those inferred from observations of FU-Orionis-type eruptions. The model predicts the existence of two types of bursts: the isolated ones, showing well-defined luminosity peaks separated with prolonged periods (~ 10^4 yr) of quiescent accretion, and clustered ones, demonstrating several bursts occurring one after another during just a few hundred years. Finally, we estimate that 40\%--70\% of the star-forming cores can display bursts after forming a star-disk system.},

	Abstract = {AA Tau, a classical T Tauri star in the Taurus cloud, has been the subject of intensive photometric monitoring for more than two decades due to its quasi-cyclic variation in optical brightness. Beginning in 2011, AA Tau showed another peculiar variation -- its median optical though near-IR flux dimmed significantly, a drop consistent with a 4-mag increase in visual extinction. It has stayed in the faint state since.Here we present 4.7um CO rovibrational spectra of AA Tau over eight epochs, covering an eleven-year time span, that reveal enhanced 12CO and 13CO absorption features in the $J_{\rm low}\leqslant$13 transitions after the dimming. These newly appeared absorptions require molecular gas along the line of sight with T~500 K and a column density of log (N12CO)~18.5 cm^{-2}, with line centers that show a constant 6 km s$^{-1}$ redshift. The properties of the molecular gas confirm an origin in the circumstellar material. We suggest that the dimming and absorption are caused by gas and dust lifted to large heights by a magnetic buoyancy instability. This material is now propagating inward, and on reaching the star within a few years will be observed as an accretion outburst.},

@article{sta15a,
	Abstract = {Direct imaging searches have revealed many very low-mass objects, including a small number of planetary mass objects, as wide-orbit companions to young stars. The formation mechanism of these objects remains uncertain. In this paper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the properties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs around objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like stars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than expected from the ${M}_{\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars with masses $M_*>0.2 {\rm M}_{\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto these objects are also higher than expected from the $\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation. Moreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown dwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the disc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have larger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent star during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they accrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc and how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates onto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc fragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and accretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young planets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations predicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the corresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the predictions of this model.},

	Abstract = {We present ALMA (Cycle 0) band-6 and band-3 observations of the transition disk Sz\,91. The disk inclination and position angle are determined to be $i=49.5\degr\pm3.5\degr$ and $\mathrm{PA}=18.2\degr\pm3.5\degr$ and the dusty and gaseous disk are detected up to $\sim220$ au and $\sim400$ au from the star, respectively. Most importantly, our continuum observations indicate that the cavity size in the mm-sized dust distribution must be $\sim97$ au in radius, the largest cavity observed around a T Tauri star. Our data clearly confirms the presence of \co(2-1) well inside the dust cavity. Based on these observational constrains we developed a disk model that simultaneously accounts for the \co and continuum observations (i.e., gaseous and dusty disk). According to our model, most of the millimeter emission comes from a ring located between 97 and 140 au. We also find that the dust cavity is divided into an innermost region largely depleted of dust particles ranging from the dust sublimation radius up to 85 au, and a second, moderately dust-depleted region, extending from 85 to 97 au. The extremely large size of the dust cavity, the presence of gas and small dust particles within the cavity and the accretion rate of Sz\,91 are consistent with the formation of multiple (giant) planets.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra High Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG) Orion Legacy Project (HOLP) is the first comprehensive set of observations of a very young massive stellar cluster which provides high resolution X-ray spectra of very young stars over a wide mass range (0.7 - 2.3 Msun). In this paper, we focus on the six brightest X-ray sources with T Tauri stellar counterparts which are well-characterized at optical and infra-red wavelengths. All stars show column densities which are substantially smaller than expected from optical extinction indicating that the sources are located on the near side of the cluster with respect to the observer as well as that these stars are embedded in more dusty environments. Stellar X-ray luminosities are well above $10^{31}$ erg/s, in some cases exceeding $10^{32}$ erg/s for a substantial amount of time. The stars during these observations show no flares but are persistently bright. The spectra can be well fit with two temperature plasma components of 10 MK and 40 MK, of which the latter dominates the flux by a ratio 6:1 on average. The total EMs range between 3 - 8$\times10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$ and are comparable to active coronal sources. Limits on the forbidden to inter-combination line ratios in the He-Like K-shell lines show that we observe a predominantely optically thin plasma with electron densities below $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. Observed abundances compare well with active coronal sources underlying the coronal nature of these sources. The surface flux in this sample of 0.6 to 2.3 Msun classical T Tauri stars shows that coronal activity and possibly coronal loop size increase significantly between ages 0.1 to 10 Myrs.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this work is to characterize the stellar population between Earth and the Orion A molecular cloud where the well-known star formation benchmark Orion nebula cluster (ONC) is embedded.  Methods: We used the denser regions the Orion A cloud to block optical background light, effectively isolating the stellar population in front of it. We then used a multi-wavelength observational approach to characterize the cloud's foreground stellar population.  Results: We find that there is a rich stellar population in front of the Orion A cloud, from B-stars to M-stars, with a distinct 1) spatial distribution; 2) luminosity function; and 3) velocity dispersion from the reddened population inside the Orion A cloud. The spatial distribution of this population peaks strongly around NGC 1980 (iota Ori) and is, in all likelihood, the extended stellar content of this poorly studied cluster. We infer an age of ~4-5 Myr for NGC 1980 and estimate a cluster population of about 2000 stars, which makes it one of the most massive clusters in the entire Orion complex. This newly found population overlaps significantly with what is currently assumed to be the ONC and the L1641N populations, and can make up for more than 10-20% of the ONC population (30-60% if the Trapezium cluster is excluded from consideration). What is currently taken in the literature as the ONC is then a mix of several intrinsically different populations, namely 1) the youngest population, including the Trapezium cluster and ongoing star formation in the dense gas inside the nebula; 2) the foreground population, dominated by the NGC 1980 cluster; and 3) the poorly constrained population of foreground and background Galactic field stars.  Conclusions: Our results support a scenario where the ONC and L1641N are not directly associated with NGC 1980, i.e., they are not the same population emerging from its parental cloud, but are instead distinct overlapping populations. The nearest massive star formation region and the template for massive star- and cluster formation models is then substantially contaminated by the foreground stellar population of the massive NGC 1980 cluster, formed about 4-5 Myr ago in a different, but perhaps related, event in the larger Orion star formation complex. This result calls for a revision of most of the observables in the benchmark ONC region (e.g., ages, age spread, cluster size, mass function, disk frequency, etc.).  Based on observations collected at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the Max-Planck-Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

	Abstract = {Aims: Following the recent discovery of a large population of young stars in front of the Orion nebula, we carried out an observational campaign with the DECam wide-field camera covering ≈10 deg2 centered on NGC 1980 to confirm, probe the extent of, and characterize this foreground population of pre-main-sequence stars.  Methods: We used multiwavelength wide-field images and catalogs to identify potential foreground pre-main-sequence stars using a novel probabilistic technique based on a careful selection of colors and luminosities.  Results: We confirm the presence of a large foreground population towards the Orion A cloud. This population contains several distinct subgroups, including NGC 1980 and NGC 1981, and stretches across several degrees in front of the Orion A cloud. By comparing the location of their sequence in various color-magnitude diagrams with other clusters, we found a distance and an age of 380 pc and 5 ~ 10 Myr, in good agreement with previous estimates. Our final sample includes 2123 candidate members and is complete from below the hydrogen-burning limit to about 0.3 M&sun;, where the data start to be limited by saturation. Extrapolating the mass function to the high masses, we estimate a total number of ≈2600 members in the surveyed region.  Conclusions: We confirm the presence of a rich, contiguous, and essentially coeval population of about 2600 foreground stars in front of the Orion A cloud, loosely clustered around NGC 1980, NGC 1981, and a new group in the foreground of the OMC-2/3. For the area of the cloud surveyed, this result implies that there are more young stars in the foreground population than young stars inside the cloud. Assuming a normal initial mass function, we estimate that between one to a few supernovae must have exploded in the foreground population in the past few million years, close to the surface of Orion A, which might be responsible, together with stellar winds, for the structure and star formation activity in these clouds. This long-overlooked foreground stellar population is of great significance, calling for a revision of the star formation history in this region of the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the origin of the mid-infrared (IR) hydrogen recombination lines for a sample of 114 disks in different evolutionary stages (full, transitional, and debris disks) collected from the Spitzer archive. We focus on the two brighter H I lines observed in the Spitzer spectra, the H I (7-6) at 12.37 mum and the H I (9-7) at 11.32 mum. We detect the H I (7-6) line in 46 objects, and the H I (9-7) in 11. We compare these lines with the other most common gas line detected in Spitzer spectra, the [Ne II] at 12.81 mum. We argue that it is unlikely that the H I emission originates from the photoevaporating upper surface layers of the disk, as has been found for the [Ne II] lines toward low-accreting stars. Using the H I (9-7)/H I (7-6) line ratios we find these gas lines are likely probing gas with hydrogen column densities of 1010-1011 cm--3. The subsample of objects surrounded by full and transitional disks show a positive correlation between the accretion luminosity and the H I line luminosity. These two results suggest that the observed mid-IR H I lines trace gas accreting onto the star in the same way as other hydrogen recombination lines at shorter wavelengths. A pure chromospheric origin of these lines can be excluded for the vast majority of full and transitional disks. We report for the first time the detection of the H I (7-6) line in eight young (<20 Myr) debris disks. A pure chromospheric origin cannot be ruled out in these objects. If the H I (7-6) line traces accretion in these older systems, as in the case of full and transitional disks, the strength of the emission implies accretion rates lower than 10--10 M ☉ yr--1. We discuss some advantages of extending accretion indicators to longer wavelengths, and the next steps required pinning down the origin of mid-IR hydrogen lines.},

	Abstract = {Results from UBVRI photometric observations of the pre-main sequence star GM Cep obtained in the period April 2011 - August 2014 are reported in the paper. Presented data are a continuation of our photometric monitoring of the star started in 2008. GM Cep is located in the field of the young open cluster Trumpler 37 and over the past years it has been an object of intense photometric and spectral studies. The star shows a strong photometric variability interpreted as a possible outburst from EXor type in previous studies. Our photometric data for a period of over six years show a large amplitude variability (Delta V ~ 2.3 mag.) and several deep minimums in brightness are observed. The analysis of the collected multicolor photometric data shows the typical of UX Ori variables a color reversal during the minimums in brightness. The observed decreases in brightness have a different shape, and evidences of periodicity are not detected. At the same time, high amplitude rapid variations in brightness typical for the classical T Tauri stars also present on the light curve of GM Cep. The spectrum of GM Cep shows the typical of classical T Tauri stars wide H/alpha emission line and absorption lines of some metals. We calculate the outer radius of the H/alpha emitting region as 10.4 +/-0.5 Rsun and the accretion rate as 1.8 x 10 E-7 Msun/yr.},

	Abstract = {We report decaying quasi-periodic intensity oscillations in the X-ray (6-12 keV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels (131, 94, 1600, 304 \AA) observed by the Fermi GBM (Gamma-ray Burst Monitor) and SDO/AIA, respectively, during a C-class flare. The estimated period of oscillation and decay time in the X-ray channel (6-12 keV) was about 202 s and 154 s, respectively. A similar oscillation period was detected at the footpoint of the arcade loops in the AIA 1600 and 304 \AA channels. Simultaneously, AIA hot channels (94 and 131 \AA) reveal propagating EUV disturbances bouncing back and forth between the footpoints of the arcade loops. The period of the oscillation and decay time were about 409 s and 1121 s, respectively. The characteristic phase speed of the wave is about 560 km/s for about 115 Mm loop length, which is roughly consistent with the sound speed at the temperature about 10-16 MK (480-608 km/s). These EUV oscillations are consistent with the SOHO/SUMER Doppler-shift oscillations interpreted as the global standing slow magnetoacoustic wave excited by a flare. The flare occurred at one of the footpoints of the arcade loops, where the magnetic topology was a 3D fan-spine with a null-point. Repetitive reconnection at this footpoint could cause the periodic acceleration of non-thermal electrons that propagated to the opposite footpoint along the arcade and precipitating there, causing the observed 202-s periodicity. Other possible interpretations, e.g. the second harmonics of the slow mode are also discussed.},

However, the exact physical processes involved are not yet fully understood. We present high angular and spectral resolution observations of the Br Gamma emitting region in the Herbig Ae star HD163296 (MWC275) in order to probe the origin of this line and constrain the physical processes taking place at sub-AU scales in the circumstellar region. By means of VLTI-AMBER observations at high spectral resolution (R~12000), we studied interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differential phases, and closure phases across the Br Gamma line of HD163296. To constrain the physical origin of the Br Gamma line in Herbig Ae stars, all the interferometric observables were compared with the predictions of a line radiative transfer disc wind model. The measured visibilities clearly increase within the Br Gamma line, indicating that the Br Gamma emitting region is more compact than the continuum. By fitting a geometric Gaussian model to the continuum-corrected Br Gamma visibilities, we derived a compact radius of the Br Gamma emitting region of ~0.07+/-0.02AU (Gaussian half width at half maximum; or a ring-fit radius of ~0.08+/-0.02AU). To interpret the observations, we developed a magneto-centrifugally driven disc wind model. Our best disc wind model is able to reproduce, within the errors, all the interferometric observables and it predicts a launching region with an outer radius of ~0.04AU. However, the intensity distribution of the entire disc wind emitting region extends up to ~0.16AU. Our observations, along with a detailed modelling of the Br Gamma emitting region, suggest that most of the Br Gamma emission in HD163296 originates from a disc wind with a launching region that is over five times more compact than previous estimates of the continuum dust rim radius.},

	Abstract = {New data from the Herschel Space Observatory are broadening our understanding of the physics and evolution of the outer regions of protoplanetary disks in star forming regions. In particular they prove to be useful to identify transitional disk candidates. The goals of this work are to complement the detections of disks and the identification of transitional disk candidates in the Lupus clouds with data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. We extracted photometry at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m of all spectroscopically confirmed Class II members previously identified in the Lupus regions and analyzed their updated spectral energy distributions. We have detected 34 young disks in Lupus in at least one Herschel band, from an initial sample of 123 known members in the observed fields. Using the criteria defined in Ribas et al. (2013) we have identified five transitional disk candidates in the region. Three of them are new to the literature. Their PACS-70 $\mu$m fluxes are systematically higher than those of normal T Tauri stars in the same associations, as already found in T Cha and in the transitional disks in the Chamaeleon molecular cloud. Herschel efficiently complements mid-infrared surveys for identifying transitional disk candidates and confirms that these objects seem to have substantially different outer disks than the T Tauri stars in the same molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {V1118 Ori is an eruptive variable belonging to the EXor class of Pre-Main Sequence stars whose episodic outbursts are attributed to disk accretion events. Since 2006, V1118 Ori is in the longest quiescence stage ever observed between two subsequent outbursts of its recent history. We present near-infrared photometry of V1118 Ori carried out during the last eight years, along with a complete spectroscopic coverage from 0.35 to 2.5 um. A longterm sampling of V1118 Ori in quiescence has never been done, hence we can benefit from the current circumstance to determine the lowest values (i.e. the zeroes) of the parameters to be used as a reference for evaluating the physical changes typical of more active phases. A quiescence mass accretion rate between 1--3 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ can be derived and the difference with previous determinations is discussed. From line emission and IR colors analysis a visual extinction of 1-2 mag is consistently derived, confirming that V1118 Ori (at least in quiescence) is a low-extinction T Tauri star with a bolometric luminosity of about 2.1 L$_{\sun}$. An anti-correlation exists between the equivalent width of the emission lines and the underlying continuum. We searched the literature for evaluating whether or not such a behaviour is a common feature of the whole class. The anti-correlation is clearly recognizable for all the available EXors in the optical range (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines), while it is not as much evident in the infrared (Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$ lines). The observed anti-correlation supports the accretion-driven mechanism as the most likely to account for continuum variations.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the analysis of UVES and GIRAFFE spectra acquired by the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey in the fields of young clusters whose population includes pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. Both methods that have been extensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of the Gaia-ESO survey enterprise are available and used. The internal precision of these quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by such different methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison with independent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravity derived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars. Specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretion signatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. The analysis carried out on spectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months of observations, up to June 2013, is presented in preparation of the first release of advanced data products. Stellar parameters obtained with the higher resolution and larger wavelength coverage from UVES are reproduced with comparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lower resolution of the GIRAFFE setup adopted for young stars, which allows us to provide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger GIRAFFE sample. Precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 K r.m.s. in Teff, $\approx$0.3 dex r.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [Fe/H], for both the UVES and GIRAFFE setups.},

	Abstract = {We present an algorithm for solving the radiative transfer problem on massively parallel computers using adaptive mesh refinement and domain decomposition. The solver is based on the method of characteristics which requires an adaptive raytracer that integrates the equation of radiative transfer. The radiation field is split into local and global components which are handled separately to overcome the non-locality problem. The solver is implemented in the framework of the magneto-hydrodynamics code FLASH and is coupled by an operator splitting step. The goal is the study of radiation in the context of star formation simulations with a focus on early disc formation and evolution. This requires a proper treatment of radiation physics that covers both the optically thin as well as the optically thick regimes and the transition region in particular. We successfully show the accuracy and feasibility of our method in a series of standard radiative transfer problems and two 3D collapse simulations resembling the early stages of protostar and disc formation.},

	Abstract = {We studied a sample of stars associated with the Sh 2-296 nebula, part of the reflection nebulae complex in the region of Canis Major (CMa R1). Our sample corresponds to optical counterparts of X-ray sources detected from observations with the XMM-Newton satellite, which revealed dozens of possible low-mass young stars not yet known in this region. A sample of 58 young star candidates were selected based on optical spectral features, mainly H{\alpha} and lithium lines, observed with multi-objects spectroscopy performed by the Gemini South telescope. Among the candidates, we find 41 confirmed T Tauri and 15 very likely young stars. Based on the H{\alpha} emission, the T Tauri stars were distinguished between classical (17%) and weak-lined (83%), but no significant difference was found in the age and mass distribution of these two classes. The characterization of the sample was complemented by near- and mid-infrared data, providing an estimate of ages and masses from the comparison with pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. While half of the young stars have an age of 1-2 Myrs or less, only a small fraction (~25%) shows evidence of IR excess revealing the presence of circumstellar discs. This low fraction is quite rare compared to most young star-forming regions, suggesting that some external factor has accelerated the disc dissipation.},

	Abstract = {We present an expanded kinematic study of the young cluster NGC 2264 based upon optical radial velocities measured using multi-fiber echelle spectroscopy at the 6.5 meter MMT and Magellan telescopes. We report radial velocities for 695 stars, of which approximately 407 stars are confirmed or very likely members. Our results more than double the number of members with radial velocities from F{\H u}r{\'e}sz et al., resulting in a much better defined kinematic relationship between the stellar population and the associated molecular gas. In particular, we find that there is a significant subset of stars that are systematically blueshifted with respect to the molecular ($^{13}$CO) gas. The detection of Lithium absorption and/or infrared excesses in this blue-shifted population suggests that at least some of these stars are cluster members; we suggest some speculative scenarios to explain their kinematics. Our results also more clearly define the redshifted population of stars in the northern end of the cluster; we suggest that the stellar and gas kinematics of this region are the result of a bubble driven by the wind from O7 star S Mon. Our results emphasize the complexity of the spatial and kinematic structure of NGC 2264, important for eventually building up a comprehensive picture of cluster formation.},

	Abstract = {We test state-of-the-art model atmospheres for young very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the infrared, by comparing the predicted synthetic photometry over 1.2-24 {\mu}m to the observed photometry of M-type spectral templates in star-forming regions. We find that (1) in both early and late young M types, the model atmospheres imply effective temperatures (Teff) several hundred Kelvin lower than predicted by the standard Pre-Main Sequence spectral type-Teff conversion scale (where the latter is based on theoretical evolutionary models). It is only in the mid-M types that the two temperature estimates agree. (2) The Teff discrepancy in the early M types (corresponding to stellar masses above 0.6 Msol at a few Myr) probably arises from remaining uncertainties in the treatment of atmospheric convection. The agreement in the mid-M types implies a reasonably good atmospheric modeling of H2O opacities, which dominate in the infrared at these spectral types. Conversely, the Teff discrepancy in the late M types is likely due to an underestimation of dust opacity in the atmospheric models, as well as an attendant overestimation of H2O opacity, due to insufficient backwarming by dust. While magnetic field/activity effects can cause Teff in M types to be lower than evolutionary models predict, this cannot explain the magnitude or the spectral type-dependency of the above Teff discrepancy. (3) The empirical and model-atmosphere J-band bolometric corrections are both roughly flat, and similar to each other, over the M-type Teff range. Thus the model atmospheres yield reasonably accurate bolometric luminosities (Lbol), but tend to overestimate radii (due to underestimated Teff), and underestimate age and mass for the early and (especially) late young M types compared to evolutionary theory; we demonstrate this by placing a large sample of young Cha I/Taurus sources on an HR diagram.},

	Abstract = {Jets are ubiquitous in the star-forming process since accretion is intimately associated with outflow. Weak free-free continuum emission in the centimeter domain is associated with these jets. Observations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized jets, close to the YSO and its accretion disk, where jets are accelerated and collimated. Optical or near-IR images are obscured by the high extinction present. Radio recombination lines in jets (in combination with proper motions) should provide their 3D kinematics. SKA will be crucial to perform this kind of observations. Thermal radio jets are associated with both low and high mass protostars. The ionizing mechanism appears to be related to shocks in the associated outflows, as suggested by the observed correlation between the centimeter luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. From this correlation and that with the bolometric luminosity of the driving star it will be possible to discriminate with SKA between unresolved HII regions and jets, and to infer physical properties of the embedded objects. Some jets show indications of non-thermal emission (negative spectral indices) in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission has been found in the lobes of the jet of HH 80-81, allowing us to measure the direction and intensity of the magnetic field, a clue ingredient in determining the jet collimation and ejection mechanisms. As only a fraction of the emission is polarized, very sensitive observations such as those that will be feasible with SKA are required to perform these studies in other objects. Jets are common in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing YSO radio jets, whose physical conditions can be reliably determined from their thermal emission, would be also useful in understanding acceleration and collimation mechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical jets.},

	Abstract = {We present a multi-epoch radio study of the Taurus-Auriga star-forming complex made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at frequencies of 4.5 GHz and 7.5 GHz. We detect a total of 610 sources, 59 of which are related to young stellar objects and 18 to field stars. The properties of 56\% of the young stars are compatible with non-thermal radio emission. We also show that the radio emission of more evolved young stellar objects tends to be more non-thermal in origin and, in general, that their radio properties are compatible with those found in other star forming regions. By comparing our results with previously reported X-ray observations, we notice that young stellar objects in Taurus-Auriga follow a G\"{u}del-Benz relation with $\kappa$=0.03, as we previously suggested for other regions of star formation. In general, young stellar objects in Taurus-Auriga and in all the previous studied regions seem to follow this relation with a dispersion of $\sim1$ dex. Finally, we propose that most of the remaining sources are related with extragalactic objects but provide a list of 46 unidentified radio sources whose radio properties are compatible with a YSO nature.},

	Abstract = {We present first results from the Survey of H I in Extremely Low-mass Dwarfs (SHIELD), a multi-configuration Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) study of the neutral gas contents and dynamics of galaxies with H I masses in the 106-107 M sun range detected by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We describe the survey motivation and concept demonstration using Very Large Array imaging of six low-mass galaxies detected in early ALFALFA data products. We then describe the primary scientific goals of SHIELD and present preliminary EVLA and WIYN 3.5 m imaging of the 12 SHIELD galaxies. With only a few exceptions, the neutral gas distributions of these extremely low-mass galaxies are centrally concentrated. In only one system have we detected H I column densities higher than 1021 cm-2. Despite this, the stellar populations of all of these systems are dominated by blue stars. Further, we find ongoing star formation as traced by Halpha emission in 10 of the 11 galaxies with Halpha imaging obtained to date. Taken together these results suggest that extremely low-mass galaxies are forming stars in conditions different from those found in more massive systems. While detailed dynamical analysis requires the completion of data acquisition, the most well-resolved system is amenable to meaningful position-velocity analysis. For AGC 749237, we find well-ordered rotation of 30 km s-1 at ~40'' distance from the dynamical center. At the adopted distance of 3.2 Mpc, this implies the presence of a gsim1 × 108 M sun dark matter halo and a baryon fraction lsim0.1.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 59 ultra-compact high velocity clouds (UCHVCs) extracted from the 40% complete ALFALFA HI-line survey. The ALFALFA UCHVCs have median flux densities of 1.34 Jy km s-1, median angular diameters of 10', and median velocity widths of 23 km s-1. We show that the full UCHVC population cannot easily be associated with known populations of high velocity clouds. Of the 59 clouds presented here, only 11 are also present in the compact cloud catalog extracted from the commensal GALFA-HI survey, demonstrating the utility of this separate dataset and analysis. Based on their sky distribution and observed properties, we infer that the ALFALFA UCHVCs are consistent with the hypothesis that they may be very low mass galaxies within the Local Volume. In that case, most of their baryons would be in the form of gas, and because of their low stellar content, they remain unidentified by extant optical surveys. At distances of ~1 Mpc, the UCHVCs have neutral hydrogen (H I) masses of ~105-106 M &sun;, H I diameters of ~2-3 kpc, and indicative dynamical masses within the H I extent of ~107-108 M &sun;, similar to the Local Group ultra-faint dwarf Leo T. The recent ALFALFA discovery of the star-forming, metal-poor, low mass galaxy Leo P demonstrates that this hypothesis is true in at least one case. In the case of the individual UCHVCs presented here, confirmation of their extragalactic nature will require further work, such as the identification of an optical counterpart to constrain their distance.},

	Abstract = {We use numerical simulations to examine the substructure within galactic and cluster mass halos that form within a hierarchical universe. Clusters are easily reproduced with a steep mass spectrum of thousands of substructure clumps that closely matches the observations. However, the survival of dark matter substructure also occurs on galactic scales, leading to the remarkable result that galaxy halos appear as scaled versions of galaxy clusters. The model predicts that the virialized extent of the Milky Way's halo should contain about 500 satellites with circular velocities larger than the Draco and Ursa Minor systems, i.e., bound masses >~108 Msolar and tidally limited sizes >~1 kpc. The substructure clumps are on orbits that take a large fraction of them through the stellar disk, leading to significant resonant and impulsive heating. Their abundance and singular density profiles have important implications for the existence of old thin disks, cold stellar streams, gravitational lensing, and indirect/direct detection experiments.},

	Abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of the radio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapid multiwavelength follow-up of an FRB has been possible. New instrumentation has decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM) of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z \lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularly polarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linear polarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the FRB. If there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected from coherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by Faraday rotation caused by passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. FRB 140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and lies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs of these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to sampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. Follow-up conducted by 12 telescopes observing from X-ray to radio wavelengths was unable to identify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out models in which FRBs originate from nearby ($z < 0.3$) supernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts.},

@article{loe14a,
	Abstract = {Six cases of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have recently been discovered. The FRBs are bright (˜0.1-1 Jy) and brief (˜1 ms) pulses of radio emission with dispersion measures (DMs) that exceed Galactic values, and hence FRBs have been interpreted to be at cosmological distances. We propose, instead, that FRBs are rare eruptions of flaring main-sequence stars within ˜1 kpc. Rather than associating their excess DM with the intergalactic medium, we relate it to a blanket of coronal plasma around their host star. We have monitored at optical bands the stars within the radio beams of three of the known FRBs. In one field, we find a bright (V = 13.6 mag) variable star (0.2 mag peak to trough) with a main-sequence G-type spectrum and a period P = 7.8 h, likely a W-UMa-type contact binary. Analysis of our data outside of the FRB beams indicates a 5 per cent probability of finding, at random, a variable star of this brightness and amplitude within the FRB beams, but this could still be a chance coincidence. We find no unusual variable stars in the other two FRB fields. Further observations are needed to investigate if similar nearby (≲800 pc) stars are the sources of FRBs.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a systematic near-infrared circular polarization (CP) survey in star-forming regions, covering high-mass, intermediate-mass, and low-mass young stellar objects. All the observations were made using the SIRPOL imaging polarimeter on the Infrared Survey Facility 1.4 m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory. We present the polarization properties of 10 sub-regions in 6 star-forming regions. The polarization patterns, extents, and maximum degrees of linear and circular polarizations are used to determine the prevalence and origin of CP in the star-forming regions. Our results show that the CP pattern is quadrupolar in general, the CP regions are extensive, up to 0.65 pc, the CP degrees are high, up to 20%, and the CP degrees decrease systematically from high- to low-mass young stellar objects. The results are consistent with dichroic extinction mechanisms generating the high degrees of CP in star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {The results of a near-infrared (J H K LP) imaging linear polarimetry survey of 20 young stellar objects (YSOs) in rho Ophiuchi are presented. The majority of the sources are unresolved, with K-band polarizations, PK < 6 per cent. Several objects are associated with extended reflection nebulae. These objects have centrosymmetric vector patterns with polarization discs over their cores; maximum polarizations of PK > 20 per cent are seen over their envelopes. Correlations are observed between the degree of core polarization and the evolutionary status inferred from the spectral energy distribution. K-band core polarizations >6 per cent are only observed in Class I YSOs.  A 3D Monte Carlo model with oblate grains aligned with a magnetic field is used to investigate the flux distributions and polarization structures of three of the rho Oph YSOs with extended nebulae. A rho ~ r-1.5 power law for the density is applied throughout the envelopes. The large-scale centrosymmetric polarization structures are due to scattering. However, the polarization structure in the bright core of the nebula appears to require dichroic extinction by aligned non-spherical dust grains. The position angle indicates a toroidal magnetic field in the inner part of the envelope. Since the measured polarizations attributed to dichroic extinction are usually <=10 per cent, the grains must either be nearly spherical or very weakly aligned. The higher polarizations observed in the outer parts of the reflection nebulae require that the dust grains responsible for scattering have maximum grain sizes <=1.05 mum.},

	Abstract = {We have mapped the linear and circular polarization in several protostars. The polarization maps are being compared to Monte Carlo radiative transfer models including the effects of scattering from aligned grains. A definitive test of grain alignment comes from resolved circular polarization maps of protostars. Aligned grains produce large values of circular polarization across the cloud, up to 25-40% in the models, whereas nonaligned grains produce maximum polarizations of only a few percent. To date, very few protostars have been observed at high spatial resolution for circular polarization. If grains are aligned, models of the linear and circular polarization maps can probe the alignment geometry and therefore the magnetic field structure.  None of the four protostars observed showed circular polarization at a level above ˜ 1-2 % (3 sigma).},

	Abstract = {We present results from deep imaging linear and circular polarimetry of the massive star-forming region NGC 6334-V. These observations show high degrees of circular polarization (CP), as much as 22% in the Ks band, in the infrared nebula associated with the outflow. The CP has an asymmetric positive/negative pattern and is very extended (~80'' or 0.65 pc). Both the high CP and its extended size are larger than those seen in the Orion CP region. Three-dimensional Monte Carlo light-scattering models are used to show that the high CP may be produced by scattering from the infrared nebula followed by dichroic extinction by an optically thick foreground cloud containing aligned dust grains. Our results show not only the magnetic field orientation of around young stellar objects, but also the structure of circumstellar matter such as outflow regions and their parent molecular cloud along the line of sight. The detection of the large and extended CP in this source and the Orion nebula may imply the CP origin of the biological homochirality on Earth.},

@article{iev14a,
	Abstract = {Context. In the past decades near-Earth objects (NEOs) have become very important targets to study, since they can give us clues to the formation, evolution, and composition of the solar system. In addition, they may represent either a threat to humankind or a repository of extraterrestrial resources for suitable space-borne missions. Within this framework, the choice of next-generation mission targets and the characterisation of a potential threat to our planet deserve special attention.  Aims: To date, only a small part of the 11 000 discovered NEOs have been physically characterised. From ground- and space-based observations, one can determine some basic physical properties of these objects using visible and infrared spectroscopy.  Methods: We present data for 13 objects observed with different telescopes around the world (NASA-IRTF, ESO-NTT, TNG) in the 0.4-2.5 mum spectral range, within the NEOSURFACE survey. Objects are chosen from among the more accessible for a rendez-vous mission. All of them are characterised by a delta-V (the change in velocity needed for transferring a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit to a rendez-vous with NEOs) lower than 10.5 km s-1, well below the solar system escape velocity (12.3 km s-1).  Results: We taxonomically classify 9 of these objects for the first time. Eleven objects belong to the S-complex taxonomy, and the other 2 belong to the C-complex. We constrain the surface composition of these objects by comparing their spectra with meteorites from the RELAB database. We also compute olivine and pyroxene mineralogy for asteroids with clear evidence of pyroxene bands. Mineralogy confirms the similarity with the already found H, L, or LL ordinary chondrite analogues.  Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory - NTT (Programs 075.C-0282, 076.C-0577 and 078.C-0141), NASA - IRTF (Program 087) and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (Sessions AOT14-TAC41, AOT15-TAC69 and AOT26-TAC32.)},

	Abstract = {The globular cluster HP 1 is projected on the bulge, very close to the Galactic center. The Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator on the Very Large Telescope allowed us to acquire high-resolution deep images that, combined with first epoch New Technology Telescope data, enabled us to derive accurate proper motions. The cluster and bulge fields' stellar contents were disentangled through this process and produced an unprecedented definition in color-magnitude diagrams of this cluster. The metallicity of [Fe/H] ≈ -1.0 from previous spectroscopic analysis is confirmed, which together with an extended blue horizontal branch imply an age older than the halo average. Orbit reconstruction results suggest that HP 1 is spatially confined within the bulge.  The observations were collected with the Very Large Telescope (Melipal) at the European Southern Observatory, ESO, in Paranal, Chile; the run was carried out in Science Demonstration Time.},

	Abstract = {We use space motions of globular clusters as a new constraint to determine the mass distribution of our Galaxy. Among the 26 globular clusters with known radial velocity and proper motions (Dauphole et al. ???), eight of them are now observed at distances smaller than or nearly 20kpc from the Galactic centre with a velocity that throws them at a distance greater than 40kpc, with the usual galactic potentials. Moreover, the time spent at large distances from the Galactic centre corresponds to a large part of the orbital period. Statistically, we must normally find a lot of globular clusters at these distances. But the distribution of the globular clusters shows a gap beyond 40kpc. We use this contradiction between observations and theory as a new constraint to build a potential model of our Galaxy, that is globular clusters with known space velocities must not have apocentric distances greater than 40 kpc or in other words the potential must be strong enough to prevent galactic globular clusters to go beyond this limit. The derived model is simple, completely analytical and works quite nicely with this large scale constraint. Total mass of the model is 7.9x10^11^Msun_. A large part of this mass must be distributed between 15 and 40kpc and must be in fact dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of several absorption lines of neutral phosphorus (P, Z = 15) in archival near-ultraviolet spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We derive phosphorus abundances or interesting upper limits in 14 late-type stars with metallicities spanning --3.8 < [Fe/H] <--0.1. Previously, phosphorus had only been studied in Galactic stars with --1.0 < [Fe/H] <+0.3. Iron lines reveal abundance offsets between the optical and ultraviolet regions, and we discuss and apply a correction factor to account for this offset. In stars with [Fe/H] >--1.0, the [P/Fe] ratio decreases toward the solar value with increasing metallicity, in agreement with previous observational studies. In stars with [Fe/H] <--1.0, lang[P/Fe]rang = +0.04 $\pm$ 0.10, which overlaps with the [P/Fe] ratios found in several high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems. This behavior hints at a primary origin in massive stars.

@article{buc14a,
	Abstract = {Approximately half of the extrasolar planets (exoplanets) with radii less than four Earth radii are in orbits with short periods. Despite their sheer abundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. The available evidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rocky planets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thick hydrogen and helium gas envelopes. Here we report the metallicities (that is, the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanet candidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into three populations defined by statistically distinct (~4.5sigma) metallicity regions. We interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes of terrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 Earth radii), gas dwarf planets with rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth radii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 Earth radii). These transitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates, implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solids inventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating the structure of planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {Many X-ray binaries remain undetected in the mid-infrared, a regime where emission from their compact jets is likely to dominate. Here, we report the detection of the black hole binary GX 339-4 with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) during a very bright, hard accretion state in 2010. Combined with a rich contemporaneous multiwavelength data set, clear spectral curvature is found in the infrared, associated with the peak flux density expected from the compact jet. An optically thin slope of ~ -0.7 and a jet radiative power of >6 × 1035 erg s-1 (d/8 kpc)2 are measured. A ~24 hr WISE light curve shows dramatic variations in mid-infrared spectral slope on timescales at least as short as the satellite orbital period ~95 minutes. There is also significant change during one pair of observations spaced by only 11 s. These variations imply that the spectral break associated with the transition from self-absorbed to optically thin jet synchrotron radiation must be varying across the full wavelength range of ~3-22 mum that WISE is sensitive to, and more. Based on four-band simultaneous mid-infrared detections, the break is constrained to frequencies of ≈4.6+3.5 - 2.0 × 1013 Hz in at least two epochs of observation, consistent with a magnetic field B ≈ 1.5($\pm$ 0.8) × 104 G assuming a single-zone synchrotron emission region. The observed variability implies that either B or the size of the acceleration zone above the jet base is being modulated by factors of ~10 on relatively short timescales.},

	Abstract = {The binary millisecond radio pulsar PSR J1023+0038 has been recently the subject of multiwavelength monitoring campaigns which revealed that an accretion disc has formed around the neutron star (since 2013 June). We present here the results of X-ray and UV observations carried out by the Swift satellite between 2013 October and 2014 May, and of optical and NIR observations performed with the REM telescope, the Liverpool Telescope, the 2.1-m telescope at the San Pedro M{\'a}rtir Observatory and the 1.52-m telescope at the Loiano observing station. The X-ray spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law, which is softer than the previous quiescent epoch (up to 2013 June). The strong correlation between the X-ray and the UV emissions indicates that the same mechanism should be responsible for part of the emission in these bands. Optical and infrared photometric observations show that the companion star is strongly irradiated. Double-peaked emission lines in the optical spectra provide compelling evidence for the presence of an outer accretion disc too. The spectral energy distribution from IR to X-rays is well modelled if the contributions from the companion, the disc and the intrabinary shock emission are all considered. Our extensive data set can be interpreted in terms of an engulfed radio pulsar: the radio pulsar is still active, but undetectable in the radio band due to a large amount of ionized material surrounding the compact object. X-rays and gamma-rays are produced in an intrabinary shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from the companion and an outer accretion disc. The intense spin-down power irradiates the disc and the companion star, accounting for the UV and optical emissions.},

	Abstract = {The peculiar low-mass X-ray binary XSS J12270-4859, associated with the Fermi/LAT source 2FGL J1227.7-4853, was in an X-ray, gamma-ray and optical low-luminosity persistent state for about a decade until the end of 2012, when it entered into the dimmest state ever observed. The nature of the compact object has been controversial until the detection of a 1.69 ms radio pulsar early 2014. We present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-IR photometry during the previous brighter and in the recent faint states. We determine the first spectroscopic orbital ephemeris and an accurate orbital period of 6.912 46(5) h. We infer a mid G-type donor star and a distance d = 1.8-2.0 kpc. The donor spectral type changes from G5 V to F5 V between inferior and superior conjunctions, a signature of strong irradiation effects. We infer a binary inclination 45$\,^{\circ}$ ≲ i ≲ 65$\,^{\circ}$ and a highly undermassive donor, M2 ˜ 0.06-0.12 M&sun;, for a neutron star mass in the range 1.4-3 M&sun;. Thus, this binary joins as the seventh member the group of `redbacks'. In the high state, the emission lines reveal the presence of an accretion disc. They tend to vanish at the donor star superior conjunction, where also flares are preferentially observed together with the occurrence of random dips. This behaviour could be related to the propeller mechanism of the neutron star recently proposed to be acting in this system during the high state. In the low state, the emission lines are absent in all orbital phases indicating that accretion has completely switched-off and that XSS J12270-4859 has transited from an accretion-powered to a rotation-powered phase.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we identify 63 bona fide new candidates to T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus-Auriga region using as baseline its ultraviolet excess. The initial data set has been defined from the GALEX all sky survey (AIS). The GALEX satellite obtained images in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and far ultraviolet (FUV) bands where the TTSs show a prominent excess, compared with main sequence or giants stars. GALEX AIS surveyed the Taurus-Auriga molecular complex, as well as, a fraction of the California Nebula and the Perseus complex; bright sources and the dark clouds themselves are avoided. The properties of the TTSs in the ultraviolet (GALEX), optical (UCAC4) and infrared (2MASS) have been defined using as qualification sample the TTSs observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer. The candidates have been identified by means of a mixed ultraviolet-optical-infrared excess set of colors; it is found that the color-color diagram FUV-NUV versus J-K is ideally suited for this purpose. From an initial sample of 163,313 bona-fide NUV sources, a final list with 63 new candidates to TTSs in the region has been produced. The search procedure has been validated by its ability to detect all known TTSs in the area surveyed: 31 TTSs. Also, it is shown that the weak-lined TTSs are located in a well defined stripe in the FUV-NUV versus J-K diagram. Moreover, we provide in this work a list of TTSs photometric standards for future GALEX-based studies of the young stellar population in star forming regions.},

	Abstract = {The soft X-ray emissions of solar flares come mainly from the bright coronal loops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process. Their ubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and energy, although the bulk of the total flare energy goes elsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by the standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) spacecraft. We analyze the suitability of the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally valuable after Sept. 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend Dolla et al. results to a list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most of them display QPP in the impulsive phase. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the newly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray variations. The QPP show up cleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of irradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We show that there is minimal phase difference between the differenced GOES energy channels, nor between them and the hard X-ray variations on short time scales. We deploy different techniques to characterize the GOES QPP, finding no systematic patterns in spite of their general prevalence and usually no strong signature of a strict periodicity. The QPP may also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase, possibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in GOES difference data for large irradiance values makes these more uncertain. We note that the QPP of the impulsive phase can result from broadband variations, for example in red-noise power law distribution, in the flare development from its basic plasma instability.},

@article{kra14a,
	Abstract = {We present ALMA observations of the FW Tau system, a close binary pair of M5 stars with a wide-orbit (300 AU projected separation) substellar companion. The companion is extremely faint and red in the optical and near-infrared, but boasts a weak far-infrared excess and optical/near-infrared emission lines indicative of a primordial accretion disk of gas and dust. The component-resolved 1.3 mm continuum emission is found to be associated only with the companion, with a flux (1.78 +/- 0.03 mJy) that indicates a dust mass of 1-2 M_Earth. While this mass reservoir is insufficient to form a giant planet, it is more than sufficient to produce an analog of the Kepler-42 exoplanetary system or the Galilean satellites. The mass and geometry of the disk-bearing FW Tau companion remains unclear. Near-infrared spectroscopy shows deep water bands that indicate a spectral type later than M5, but substantial veiling prevents a more accurate determination of the effective temperature (and hence mass). Both a disk-bearing "planetary-mass" companion seen in direct light or a brown dwarf tertiary viewed in light scattered by an edge-on disk or envelope remain possibilities.},

	Abstract = {The turbulent motion within molecular clouds is a key factor controlling star formation. Turbulence supports molecular cloud cores from evolving to gravitational collapse and hence sets a lower bound on the size of molecular cloud cores in which star formation can occur. On the other hand, without a continuous external energy source maintaining the turbulence, such as in molecular clouds, the turbulence decays with an energy dissipation time comparable to the dynamic timescale of clouds, which could change the size limits obtained from Jean's criterion by assuming constant turbulence intensities. Here we adopt scaling relations of physical variables in decaying turbulence to analyze its specific effects on the formation of stars. We find that the decay of turbulence provides an additional approach for Jeans' criterion to be achieved, after which gravitational infall governs the motion of the cloud core. This epoch of turbulence decay is defined as cloud core relaxation. The existence of cloud core relaxation provides a more complete understanding in the competition between turbulence and gravity on the dynamics of molecular cloud cores and star formation.},

@article{cos14b,
	Abstract = {Solar flares involve impulsive energy release, which results in enhanced radiation in a broad spectral and at a wide height range. In particular, line emission from the chromosphere (lower atmosphere) can provide critical diagnostics of plasma heating processes. Thus, a direct comparison between high-resolution spectroscopic observations and advanced numerical modeling results can be extremely valuable, but has not been attempted so far. We present in this paper such a self-consistent investigation of an M3.0 flare observed by the Dunn Solar Telescope's (DST) Interferometric Bi-dimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) on 2011 September 24 that we have modeled with the radiative hydrodynamic code RADYN (Carlsson & Stein 1992, 1997; Abbett & Hawley 1999; Allred et al. 2005). We obtained images and spectra of the flaring region with IBIS in H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA\ and Ca II 8542 \AA, and with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in X-rays. The latter was used to infer the non-thermal electron population, which was passed to RADYN to simulate the atmospheric response to electron collisional heating. We then synthesized spectral lines and compared their shapes and intensities with those observed by IBIS and found that they exhibit an agreement in general. In particular, the synthetic Ca II 8542 \AA\ profile fits well to the observed profile, while the synthetic H$\alpha$ profile is fainter in the core than the observation. This indicates that H$\alpha$ emission is more responsive to the non-thermal electron flux than the Ca II 8542 \AA\ emission. We suggest that a refinement of the energy input and other processes is necessary to resolve this discrepancy.},

	Abstract = {Lomax et al. have constructed an ensemble of 60 prestellar cores having masses, sizes, projected shapes, temperatures and non-thermal radial velocity dispersions that match, statistically, the cores in Ophiuchus; and have simulated the evolution of these cores using SPH. Each core has been evolved once with no radiative feedback from stars, once with continuous radiative feedback, and once with episodic radiative feedback. Here we analyse the multiplicity statistics from these simulations. With episodic radiative feedback, (i) the multiplicity frequency is ~60% higher than in the field; (ii) the multiplicity frequency and the mean semi-major axis both increase with primary mass; (iii) one third of multiple systems are hierarchical systems with more than two components; (iv) in these hierarchical systems the inner pairings typically have separations of a few au and mass ratios concentrated towards unity, whereas the outer pairings have separations of order 100 au and a flatter distribution of mass ratios. The binary statistics are compatible with observations of young embedded populations, and -- if wider orbits are disrupted preferentially by external perturbations -- with observations of mature field populations. With no radiative feedback, the results are similar to those from simulations with episodic feedback. With continuous radiative feedback, brown dwarfs are under-produced, the number of multiple systems is too low, and the statistical properties of multiple systems are at variance with observation. This suggests that star formation in Ophiuchus may only be representative of global star formation if accretion onto protostars, and hence radiative feedback, is episodic.},

	Abstract = {We present Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectra of T Tauri stars, in which we detect amorphous and crystalline water ice features. Using irradiated accretion disk models, we determine the disk structure and ice abundance in each of the systems. Combining a model-independent comparison of the ice feature strength and disk size with a detailed analysis of the model ice location, we estimate that the ice emitting region is at disk radii >30AU, consistent with a proto-Kuiper belt. Vertically, the ice emits most below the photodesorption zone, consistent with Herschel observations of cold water vapor. The presence of crystallized water ice at a disk location a) colder than its crystallization temperature and b) where it should have been re-amorphized in ~1 Myr suggests that localized generation is occurring; the most likely cause appears to be micrometeorite impact or planetesimal collisions. Based on simple tests with UV models and different ice distributions, we suggest that the SED shape from 20 to 50 micron may probe the location of the water ice snow line in the disk upper layers. This project represents one of the first extra-solar probes of the spatial structure of the cometary ice reservoir thought to deliver water to terrestrial planets.},

	Abstract = {Context. As a galaxy evolves, its chemical composition changes and the abundance ratios of different elements are powerful probes of the underlying evolutionary processes. Phosphorous is an element whose evolution has remained quite elusive until now, because it is difficult to detect in cool stars. The infrared weak P i lines of the multiplet 1, at 1050-1082 nm, are the most reliable indicators of the presence of phosphorus. The availability of CRIRES at VLT has permitted access to this wavelength range in stellar spectra.  Aims: We attempt to measure the phosphorus abundance of twenty cool stars in the Galactic disk.  Methods: The spectra are analysed with one-dimensional model-atmospheres computed in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The line formation computations are performed assuming LTE.  Results: The ratio of phosphorus to iron behaves similarly to sulphur, increasing towards lower metallicity stars. Its ratio with respect to sulphur is roughly constant and slightly larger than solar, [P/S] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.10.  Conclusions: We succeed in taking an important step towards the understanding of the chemical evolution of phosphorus in the Galaxy. However, the observed rise in the P/Fe abundance ratio is steeper than predicted by Galactic chemical evolution model developed by Kobayashi and collaborators. Phosphorus appears to evolve differently from the light odd-Z elements sodium and aluminium. The constant value of [P/S] with metallicity implies that P production is insensitive to the neutron excess, thus processes other than neutron captures operate. We suggest that proton captures on 30Si and alpha captures on 27Al are possibilities to investigate. We see no clear distinction between our results for stars with planets and stars without any detected planet.  Based on observations obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph at ESO-VLT Antu 8.2 m telescope at Paranal, Programme 386.D-0130, P.I. E. Caffau.},

	Abstract = {We present multiple epochs of near-IR spectroscopy for a sample of 25 young stars, including T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be, and FU Ori objects. Using the FSPEC instrument on the Bok 90-inch telescope, we obtained K-band spectra of the BrGamma transition of hydrogen, with a resolution of ~3500. Epochs were taken over a span of >1 year, sampling time-spacings of roughly one day, one month, and one year. The majority of our targets show BrGamma emission, and in some cases these are the first published detections. Time-variability is seen in approximately half of the targets showing BrGamma emission. We compare the observed variability with expectations for rotationally-modulated accretion onto the central stars and time-variable continuum emission or extinction from matter in the inner disk. Our observations are not entirely consistent with models of rotationally-modulated magnetospheric accretion. Further monitoring, over a larger number of epochs, will facilitate more quantitative constraints on variability timescales and amplitudes, and a more conclusive comparison with theoretical models.},

@article{spa14a,
	Abstract = {Star formation proceeds via the collapse of a molecular cloud core over multiple dynamical timescales. Turbulence within cores results in a spatially non-uniform angular momentum of the cloud, causing a stochastic variation in orientation of the disk forming from the collapsing material. In the absence of star-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a natural mechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in the resulting planetary systems. However, owing to high accretion rates in the embedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar disk extends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational and accretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk. Here, we demonstrate that the resulting gravitational coupling is sufficient to suppress any significant star-disk misalignment, with accretion playing a secondary role. The joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wandering of star-aligned bipolar outflows. Such wandering widens the effective opening angle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of the remainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope. Accordingly, the processes described in this work provide an additional mechanism responsible for sculpting the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).},

	Abstract = {A solar eruption after a flare on 7 Jun 2011 produced EUV-bright impacts of fallbacks far from the eruption site, observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These impacts can be taken as a template for the impact of stellar accretion flows. Broad red-shifted UV lines have been commonly observed in young accreting stars. Here we study the emission from the impacts in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly's UV channels and compare the inferred velocity distribution to stellar observations. We model the impacts with 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the localised UV 1600A emission and its timing with respect to the EUV emission can be explained by the impact of a cloud of fragments. The first impacts produce strong initial upflows. The following fragments are hit and shocked by these upflows. The UV emission comes mostly from the shocked front shell of the fragments while they are still falling, and is therefore redshifted when observed from above. The EUV emission instead continues from the hot surface layer that is fed by the impacts. Fragmented accretion can therefore explain broad redshifted UV lines (e.g. C IV 1550A) to speeds around 400 km/s observed in accreting young stellar objects.},

	Abstract = {The Orion Molecular Complex is the nearest site of ongoing high-mass star formation, making it one of the most extensively studied molecular complexes in the Galaxy. We have developed a new technique for mapping the 3D distribution of dust in the Galaxy using Pan-STARRS1 photometry. We isolate the dust at the distance to Orion using this technique, revealing a large (100 pc, 14 degree diameter), previously unrecognized ring of dust, which we term the "Orion dust ring." The ring includes Orion A and B, and is not coincident with current H-alpha features. The circular morphology suggests formation as an ancient bubble in the interstellar medium, though we have not been able to conclusively identify the source of the bubble. This hint at the history of Orion may have important consequences for models of high-mass star formation and triggered star formation.},

	Abstract = {We report on the analysis of the Chandra-ACIS data of O, B and WR stars in the young association Cyg OB2. X-ray spectra of 49 O-stars, 54 B-stars and 3 WR-stars are analyzed and for the brighter sources, the epoch dependence of the X-ray fluxes is investigated. The O-stars in Cyg\,OB2 follow a well-defined scaling relation between their X-ray and bolometric luminosities: log(Lx/Lbol) = -7.2 +/- 0.2. This relation is in excellent agreement with the one previously derived for the Carina OB1 association. Except for the brightest O-star binaries, there is no general X-ray overluminosity due to colliding winds in O-star binaries. Roughly half of the known B-stars in the surveyed field are detected, but they fail to display a clear relationship between Lx and Lbol. Out of the three WR stars in Cyg OB2, probably only WR144 is itself responsible for the observed level of X-ray emission, at a very low log(Lx/Lbol) = -8.8 +/- 0.2. The X-ray emission of the other two WR-stars (WR145 and 146) is most probably due to their O-type companion along with a moderate contribution from a wind-wind interaction zone.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study the variability of the Fe 6.4 keV emission line from the Class I young stellar object Elias 29 in the rho Oph cloud.  Methods: We analysed the data from Elias 29 collected by XMM-Newton during a nine-day, nearly continuous observation of the rho Oph star-forming region (the Deep Rho-Oph X-ray Observation, named droxo). The data were subdivided into six homogeneous time intervals, and the six resulting spectra were individually analysed.  Results: We detect significant variability in the equivalent width of the Fe 6.4 keV emission line from Elias 29. The 6.4 keV line is absent during the first time interval of observation and appears at its maximum strength during the second time interval (90 ks after Elias 29 undergoes a strong flare). The X-ray thermal emission is unchanged between the two observation segments, while line variability is present at a 99.9% confidence level. Given the significant line variability in the absence of variations in the X-ray ionising continuum and the weakness of the photoionising continuum from the star's thermal X-ray emission, we suggest that the fluorescence may be induced by collisional ionisation from an (unseen) population of non-thermal electrons. We speculate on the possibility that the electrons are accelerated in a reconnection event of a magnetically confined accretion loop, connecting the young star to its circumstellar disk.},

@article{tia14a,
	Abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant energy release mechanism in solar flares. The standard flare model predicts both downward and upward outflow plasmas with speeds close to the coronal Alfv\'{e}n speed. Yet, spectroscopic observations of such outflows, especially the downflows, are extremely rare. With observations of the newly launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), we report the detection of greatly redshifted ($\sim$125 km s$^{-1}$ along line of sight) Fe {\sc{xxi}} 1354.08\AA{} emission line with a $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ nonthermal width at the reconnection site of a flare. The redshifted Fe {\sc{xxi}} feature coincides spatially with the loop-top X-Ray source observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). We interpret this large redshift as the signature of downward-moving reconnection outflow/hot retracting loops. Imaging observations from both IRIS and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) also reveal the eruption and reconnection processes. Fast downward-propagating blobs along these loops are also found from cool emission lines (e.g., Si {\sc{iv}}, O {\sc{iv}}, C {\sc{ii}}, Mg {\sc{ii}}) and images of AIA and IRIS. Furthermore, the entire Fe {\sc{xxi}} line is blueshifted by $\sim$260 km s$^{-1}$ at the loop footpoints, where the cool lines mentioned above all exhibit obvious redshift, a result that is consistent with the scenario of chromospheric evaporation induced by downward-propagating nonthermal electrons from the reconnection site.},

	Abstract = {We conducted Herschel/PACS observations of five very low-mass stars or brown dwarfs located in the TW Hya association with the goal of characterizing the properties of disks in the low stellar mass regime. We detected all five targets at $70\,\mu{\rm{m}}$ and $100\,\mu{\rm{m}}$ and three targets at $160\,\mu{\rm{m}}$. Our observations, combined with previous photometry from 2MASS, WISE, and SCUBA-2, enabled us to construct SEDs with extended wavelength coverage. Using sophisticated radiative transfer models, we analyzed the observed SEDs of the five detected objects with a hybrid fitting strategy that combines the model grids and the simulated annealing algorithm and evaluated the constraints on the disk properties via the Bayesian inference method. The modelling suggests that disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are generally flatter than their higher mass counterparts, but the range of disk mass extends to well below the value found in T Tauri stars, and the disk scale heights are comparable in both groups. The inferred disk properties (i.e., disk mass, flaring, and scale height) in the low stellar mass regime are consistent with previous findings from large samples of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars. We discuss the dependence of disk properties on their host stellar parameters and find a significant correlation between the Herschel far-IR fluxes and the stellar effective temperatures, probably indicating that the scaling between the stellar and disk masses (i.e., $M_{\rm{disk}} \propto M_{\star}$) observed mainly in low-mass stars may extend down to the brown dwarf regime.},

There is a total of 1,555,174 ultraviolet sources that were cross-matched with others catalogs (2MASS, UCAC4, SDSS, DENIS, CMC15 and WISE) to produce a list of 290,717 reliable sources with a wide range of photometric information. Using different color selection criteria we identify 111 Young Stellar Object candidates showing both ultraviolet and infrared excesses, of which 81 are new identifications. We discuss the spatial distribution, the spectral energy distributions and other physical properties of these stars. Their properties are, in general, compatible with those expected for T Tauri stars. This population of TTS candidates is widely dispersed around the Orion molecular cloud.},

	Abstract = {We present near-IR and far-UV observations of the pre-transitional (gapped) disk in HD 169142 using NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and Hubble Space Telescope. The combination of our data along with existing data sets into the broadband spectral energy distribution reveals variability of up to 45% between ~1.5-10 {\mu}m over a maximum timescale of 10 years. All observations known to us separate into two distinct states corresponding to a high near-IR state in the pre-2000 epoch and a low state in the post-2000 epoch, indicating activity within the <1 AU region of the disk. Through analysis of the Pa {\beta} and Br {\gamma} lines in our data we derive a mass accretion rate in May 2013 of (1.5 - 2.7) x 10^-9 Msun/yr. We present a theoretical modeling analysis of the disk in HD 169142 using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulation software to explore the conditions and perhaps signs of planetary formation in our collection of 24 years of observations. We find that shifting the outer edge (r = 0.3 AU) of the inner disk by 0.05 AU toward the star (in simulation of accretion and/or sculpting by forming planets) successfully reproduces the shift in NIR flux. We establish that the ~40-70 AU dark ring imaged in the NIR by Quanz et al. (2013) and Momose et al. (2013) and at 7 mm by Osorio et al. (2014) may be reproduced with a 30% scaled density profile throughout the region, strengthening the link to this structure being dynamically cleared by one or more planetary mass bodies.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method based on a Bayesian analysis to identify new members of nearby young kinematic groups. The analysis minimally takes into account the position, proper motion, magnitude, and color of a star, but other observables can be readily added (e.g., radial velocity, distance). We use this method to find new young low-mass stars in the beta Pictoris and AB Doradus moving groups and in the TW Hydrae, Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations. Starting from a sample of 758 mid-K to mid-M (K5V-M5V) stars showing youth indicators such as Halpha and X-ray emission, our analysis yields 214 new highly probable low-mass members of the kinematic groups analyzed. One is in TW Hydrae, 37 in beta Pictoris, 17 in Tucana-Horologium, 20 in Columba, 6 in Carina, 50 in Argus, 32 in AB Doradus, and the remaining 51 candidates are likely young but have an ambiguous membership to more than one association. The false alarm rate for new candidates is estimated to be 5% for beta Pictoris and TW Hydrae, 10% for Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus, and 14% for AB Doradus. Our analysis confirms the membership of 58 stars proposed in the literature. Firm membership confirmation of our new candidates will require measurement of their radial velocity (predicted by our analysis), parallax, and lithium 6708 {\AA} equivalent width. We have initiated these follow-up observations for a number of candidates, and we have identified two stars (2MASSJ01112542+1526214, 2MASSJ05241914-1601153) as very strong candidate members of the beta Pictoris moving group and one strong candidate member (2MASSJ05332558-5117131) of the Tucana-Horologium association; these three stars have radial velocity measurements confirming their membership and lithium detections consistent with young age.  Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

@article{rod13a,
	Abstract = {We describe a method that exploits data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) ultraviolet and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared source catalogs, combined with proper motions and empirical pre-main sequence isochrones, to identify candidate nearby, young, low-mass stars. Applying our method across the full GALEX-covered sky, we identify 2031 mostly M-type stars that, for an assumed age of 10 (100) Myr, all lie within ~150 (~90) pc of Earth. The distribution of M spectral subclasses among these ~2000 candidate young stars peaks sharply in the range M3-M4; these subtypes constitute 50% of the sample, consistent with studies of the M star population in the immediate solar neighborhood. We focus on a subset of 58 of these candidate young M stars in the vicinity of the Tucana-Horologium association. Only 20 of these 58 candidates were detected in the ROSAT All-Sky X-ray Survey---reflecting the greater sensitivity of GALEX for the purposes of identifying active nearby, young stars, particularly for stars of type M4 and later. Based on statistical analysis of the kinematics and/or spectroscopic followup of these 58 M stars, we find that 50% (29 stars) indeed have properties consistent with Tuc-Hor membership, while 12 are potential new members of the Columba association, and 2 may be AB Dor moving group members. Hence, ~75% of our initial subsample of 58 candidates are likely members of young (age ~ 10-40 Myr) stellar moving groups within 100 pc, verifying that the stellar color- and kinematics-based selection algorithms described here can be used to efficiently isolate nearby, young, low-mass objects from among the field star population. Future studies will focus on characterizing additional subsamples selected from among this list of candidate nearby, young M stars.},

	Abstract = {We study the differences in chromospheric structure induced in K stars by stellar activity, to expand our previous work for G stars, including the Sun as a star. We selected six stars of spectral type K with 0.82 < B - V < 0.90, including the widely studied EpsilonEridani and a variety of magnetic activity levels. We computed chromospheric models for the stars in the sample, in most cases in two different moments of activity. The models were constructed to obtain the best possible match with the CaII K and the Hbeta observed profiles. We also computed in detail the net radiative losses for each model to constrain the heating mechanism that can maintain the structure in the atmosphere. We find a strong correlation between these losses and SCaII, the index generally used as a proxy for activity, as we found for G stars.},

@article{lin13a,
	Abstract = {The Lyalpha emission line dominates the far-ultraviolet spectra of late-type stars and is a major source for photodissociation of important molecules including H2O, CH4, and CO2 in exoplanet atmospheres. The incident flux in this line illuminating an exoplanet's atmosphere cannot be measured directly as neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM) attenuates most of the flux reaching the Earth. Reconstruction of the intrinsic Lyalpha line has been accomplished for a limited number of nearby stars, but is not feasible for distant or faint host stars. We identify correlations connecting the intrinsic Lyalpha flux with the flux in other emission lines formed in the stellar chromosphere, and find that these correlations depend only gradually on the flux in the other lines. These correlations, which are based on Hubble Space Telescope spectra, reconstructed Lyalpha line fluxes, and irradiance spectra of the quiet and active Sun, are required for photochemical models of exoplanet atmospheres when intrinsic Lyalpha fluxes are not available. We find a tight correlation of the intrinsic Lyalpha flux with stellar X-ray flux for F5 V to K5 V stars, but much larger dispersion for M stars. We also show that knowledge of the stellar effective temperature and rotation rate can provide reasonably accurate estimates of the Lyalpha flux for G and K stars, and less accurate estimates for cooler stars.},

	Abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiations (10-117 nm) from host stars play important roles in the ionization, heating, and mass loss from exoplanet atmospheres. Together with the host star's Lyalpha and far-UV (117-170 nm) radiation, EUV radiation photodissociates important molecules, thereby changing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres. Since stellar EUV fluxes cannot now be measured and interstellar neutral hydrogen completely obscures stellar radiation between 40 and 91.2 nm, even for the nearest stars, we must estimate the unobservable EUV flux by indirect methods. New non-LTE semiempirical models of the solar chromosphere and corona and solar irradiance measurements show that the ratio of EUV flux in a variety of wavelength bands to the Lyalpha flux varies slowly with the Lyalpha flux and thus with the magnetic heating rate. This suggests and we confirm that solar EUV/Lyalpha flux ratios based on the models and observations are similar to the available 10-40 nm flux ratios observed with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite and the 91.2-117 nm flux observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite for F5 V-M5 V stars. We provide formulae for predicting EUV flux ratios based on the EUVE and FUSE stellar data and on the solar models, which are essential input for modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We investigate the influence of high-energy stellar radiation at close-in orbits on atmospheric mass loss during the stellar evolution of a G-type star.  Methods: High-energy stellar luminosity varies over a wide range for G field stars. The X-ray luminosity distributions from the Pleiades, the Hyades, and the field are used to derive a scaling law for the evolution of the stellar X-ray luminosity distribution. A modified energy-limited escape approach is taken for calculating atmospheric mass loss for a broad range of planetary parameters. Results: We show that the evolution of close-in exoplanets strongly depends on the detailed X-ray luminosity history of their host stars, which varies over several orders-of-magnitude for G stars. Stars located in the high-energy tail of the luminosity distribution can evaporate most of its planets within 0.5 AU, while a significant fraction of planets can survive if exposed to a moderate X-ray luminosity. We show the change on an initial planetary mass distribution caused by atmospheric escape.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study the influence of the X-ray luminosity distribution of dM stars on mass loss from planets on close-in orbits.  Methods: Using the X-ray luminosity of the Pleiades, the Hyades, and field dM stars, we construct a scaling law for the radiation environment of dM stars for ages between 0.1 and 10 Gyr. An energy-limited escape approach is used to calculate the influence of thermal mass loss on planetary distribution functions.  Results: We show that the X-ray luminosity distribution of nearby dM stars can be described by using a scaling law derived from observations of open clusters with a given age. It is shown that the X-ray flux from dM stars is significantly less than the flux from dG stars for a given orbital distance. Therefore, loss processes have less of an impact on the mass evolution of planets orbiting dM stars. We found that the mass loss is negligible for hydrogen-rich Jupiter-mass planets at orbits >0.02 AU, while Neptune-mass planets are influenced up to 0.05 AU. At orbits of 0.02 AU, Roche lobe effects are also having a strong impact on the mass-loss evolution. Because of the low mass of dM stars, Roche lobe effects are less effective for loss processes at planets orbiting these stars. Finally, if we use only the X-ray luminosity of their host stars for the energy input to the atmosphere, we obtain a lower limit for the mass loss of GJ876d and GJ674b. This does not allow us to conclude whether they are remnants of eroded Jupiter-mass planets.},

	Abstract = {Rich young stellar clusters produce H II regions whose expansion into the nearby molecular cloud is thought to trigger the formation of new stars. However, the importance of this mode of star formation is uncertain. This investigation seeks to quantify triggered star formation (TSF) in IC 1396A (aka the Elephant Trunk Nebula), a bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) on the periphery of the nearby giant H II region IC 1396 produced by the Trumpler 37 cluster. X-ray selection of young stars from Chandra X-ray Observatory data is combined with existing optical and infrared surveys to give a more complete census of the TSF population. Over 250 young stars in and around IC 1396A are identified; this doubles the previously known population. A spatio-temporal gradient of stars from the IC 1396A cloud towards the primary ionizing star HD 206267 is found. We argue that the TSF mechanism in IC 1396A is a radiation-driven implosion process persisting over several million years. Analysis of the X-ray luminosity and initial mass functions indicates that >140 stars down to 0.1 M&sun; were formed by TSF. Considering other BRCs in the IC 1396 H II region, we estimate the TSF contribution for the entire H II region exceeds 14-25 per cent today, and may be higher over the lifetime of the H II region. Such triggering on the periphery of H II regions may be a significant mode of star formation in the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {By extending our previous study by Maehara et al., we searched for superflares on G-type dwarfs (solar-type stars) using Kepler data for a longer period (500 days) than that (120 days) in our previous study. As a result, we found 1547 superflares on 279 G-type dwarfs, which is much more than the previous 365 superflares on 148 stars. Using these new data, we studied the statistical properties of the occurrence rate of superflares, and confirmed the previous results, i.e., the occurrence rate (dN/dE) of superflares versus flare energy (E) shows a power-law distribution with dN/dEvpropE -alpha, where alpha ~ 2. It is interesting that this distribution is roughly similar to that for solar flares. In the case of the Sun-like stars (with surface temperature 5600-6000 K and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10 days), the occurrence rate of superflares with an energy of 1034-1035 erg is once in 800-5000 yr. We also studied long-term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of these superflare stars and found that in some G-type dwarfs the occurrence rate of superflares was extremely high, ~57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in 10 days). In the case of Sun-like stars, the most active stars show a frequency of one superflare (with 1034 erg) in 100 days. There is evidence that these superflare stars have extremely large starspots with a size about 10 times larger than that of the largest sunspot. We argue that the physical origin of the extremely high occurrence rate of superflares in these stars may be attributed to the existence of extremely large starspots.},

	Abstract = {Solar flares are caused by the sudden release of magnetic energy stored near sunspots. They release 1029 to 1032 ergs of energy on a timescale of hours. Similar flares have been observed on many stars, with larger `superflares' seen on a variety of stars, some of which are rapidly rotating and some of which are of ordinary solar type. The small number of superflares observed on solar-type stars has hitherto precluded a detailed study of them. Here we report observations of 365 superflares, including some from slowly rotating solar-type stars, from about 83,000 stars observed over 120 days. Quasi-periodic brightness modulations observed in the solar-type stars suggest that they have much larger starspots than does the Sun. The maximum energy of the flare is not correlated with the stellar rotation period, but the data suggest that superflares occur more frequently on rapidly rotating stars. It has been proposed that hot Jupiters may be important in the generation of superflares on solar-type stars, but none have been discovered around the stars that we have studied, indicating that hot Jupiters associated with superflares are rare.},

	Abstract = {The recent increase in the number of radius measurements of very low mass stars from eclipsing binaries and interferometry of single stars has raised more questions about what could be causing the discrepancy between the observed radii and those predicted by models. The two main explanations being proposed are a correlation between the radii of the stars and either their activity levels or their metallicities. This paper presents a study of such correlations using all the data published to date. The study also investigates correlations between the radius deviations from the models and the masses of the stars. There is no clear correlation between activity level and radius for the single stars in the sample. These single stars are slow rotators, with typical velocities vrotsini<3.0 km s-1. A clear correlation however exists in the case of the faster rotating members of binaries. This result is based on the X-ray emission levels of the stars. There also appears to be an increase in the deviation of the radii of single stars from the models as a function of metallicity, as previously indicated by Berger et al. The stars in binaries do not seem to follow the same trend. Finally, the Baraffe et al. models reproduce well the radius observations below 0.30-0.35 Msolar, where the stars become fully convective, although this result is preliminary since almost all the sample stars in that mass range are slow rotators and metallicities have not been measured for most of them. The results indicate that stellar activity and metallicity play an important role in determining the radius of very low mass stars, at least above 0.35 Msolar.},

	Abstract = {Here, BV(RI)_C broad band photometry and intermediate resolution spectroscopy in Halpha region are presented for two rapidly rotating late-type stars: EY Dra and V374 Peg. For a third rapid rotator, GSC 02038-00293, intermediate resolution Halpha spectroscopy and low resolution spectroscopy are used for spectral classification and stellar parameter investigation of this poorly known object. The low resolution spectrum of GSC 02038-00293 clearly indicates that it is a K-type star. Its intermediate resolution spectrum can be best fitted with a model with T_eff=4750 K and v sin i=90{ km s-1}, indicating a very rapidly rotating mid-K star. The Halpha line strength is variable, indicating changing chromospheric emission on GSC 02038-00293. In the case of EY Dra and V374 Peg, the stellar activity in the photosphere is investigated from the photometric observations, and in the chromosphere from the Halpha line. The enhanced chromospheric emission in EY Dra correlates well with the location of the photospheric active regions, indicating that these features are spatially collocated. Hints of this behaviour are also seen in V374 Peg, but it cannot be confirmed from the current data. The photospheric activity patterns in EY Dra are stable during one observing run lasting several nights, whereas in V374 Peg large night-to-night variations are seen. Two large flares, one in the Halpha observations and one from the broadband photometry, and twelve smaller ones were detected in V374 Peg during the observations spanning nine nights. The energy of the photometrically detected largest flare is estimated to be 4.25 ×  1031- 4.3 × 1032 erg, depending on the waveband. Comparing the activity patterns in these two stars, which are just below and above the mass limit of full convection, is crucial for understanding dynamo operation in stars with different internal structures.  Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma, Spain; Isaac Newton Telescope of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes, La Palma, Spain; 60-cm and 1-m telescopes of Konkoly Observatory, Hungary.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the fast-rotating (P_orb=P_rot=0.465d), active dwarf binary V405 And (M0V+M5V) using photometric BV(RI)C and optical spectroscopic data. The light variation is caused by the combined effect of spottedness and binarity with a small eclipse. We estimate the system parameters from the available light and radial velocity curves. Three flare events occurred during the observations: two were found in the spectroscopic data and one was observed photometrically in BV(RI)C colours. An interesting eruptive phenomenon emerged from the photometric measurements that can be interpreted as a series of post-flare eruptions lasting for at least 3 orbits (rotations) of the system, originating from trans-equatorial magnetic loops, which connect the active regions in the two hemispheres. The two components of V405 And have masses well over and below the theoretical limit of full convection. This rare property makes the binary an ideal target for observing and testing models for stellar dynamo action.},

	Abstract = {Context. Although chromospheric activity cycles have been studied in a larger number of late-type stars for quite some time, very little is known about coronal activity-cycles in other stars and their similarities or dissimilarities with the solar activity cycle.  Aims: While it is usually assumed that cyclic activity is present only in stars of low to moderate activity, we investigate whether the ultra-fast rotator AB Dor, a K dwarf exhibiting signs of substantial magnetic activity in essentially all wavelength bands, exhibits an X-ray activity cycle in analogy to its photospheric activity cycle of about 17 years and possible correlations between these bands.  Methods: We analysed the combined optical photometric data of AB Dor A, which span ~35 years. Additionally, we used ROSAT and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of AB Dor A to study the long-term evolution of magnetic activity in this active K dwarf over nearly three decades and searched for X-ray activity cycles and related photometric brightness changes.  Results: AB Dor A exhibits photometric brightness variations ranging between 6.75 < Vmag <= 7.15 while the X-ray luminosities range between 29.8 < log LX [erg/s] <= 30.2 in the 0.3-2.5 keV. As a very active star, AB Dor A shows frequent X-ray flaring, but in the long XMM-Newton observations a kind of basal state is attained very often. This basal state probably varies with the photospheric activity-cycle of AB Dor A, which has a period of ~17 years, but the X-ray variability amounts at most to a factor of ~2, which is, much lower than the typical cycle amplitudes found on the Sun.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the chromosphere and corona of the ultra-fast rotator AB Dor A at high temporal and spectral resolution using simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton in the X-rays, VLT/UVES in the optical, and the ATCA in the radio. Our optical spectra have a resolving power of ~50 000 with a time cadence of ~1 min. Our observations continuously cover more than one rotational period and include both quiescent periods and three flaring events of different strengths.  Methods: From the X-ray observations we investigated the variations in coronal temperature, emission measure, densities, and abundance. We interpreted our data in terms of a loop model. From the optical data we characterised the flaring chromospheric material using numerous emission lines that appear in the course of the flares. A detailed analysis of the line shapes and line centres allowed us to infer physical characteristics of the flaring chromosphere and to coarsely localise the flare event on the star.  Results: We specifically used the optical high-cadence spectra to demonstrate that both turbulent and Stark broadening are present during the first ten minutes of the first flare. Also, in the first few minutes of this flare, we find short-lived (one to several minutes) emission subcomponents in the Halpha and Ca ii K lines, which we interpret as flare-connected shocks owing to their high intrinsic velocities. Combining the space-based data with the results of our optical spectroscopy, we derive flare-filling factors. Finally, comparing X-ray, optical broadband, and line emission, we find a correlation for two of the three flaring events, while there is no clear correlation for one event. Also, we do not find any correlation of the radio data to any other observed data.

	Abstract = {While the strong anticorrelation between chromospheric activity and age has led to the common use of the Ca II H and K emission index (R'HK=LHK/Lbol) as an empirical age estimator for solar-type dwarfs, existing activity-age relations produce implausible ages at both high and low activity levels. We have compiled R'HK data from the literature for young stellar clusters, richly populating for the first time the young end of the activity-age relation. Combining the cluster activity data with modern cluster age estimates and analyzing the color dependence of the chromospheric activity age index, we derive an improved activity-age calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs (0.5 mag<B-V<0.9 mag). We also present a more fundamentally motivated activity-age calibration that relies on conversion of R'HK values through the Rossby number to rotation periods and then makes use of improved gyrochronology relations. We demonstrate that our new activity-age calibration has typical age precision of ~0.2 dex for normal solar-type dwarfs aged between the Hyades and the Sun (~0.6-4.5 Gyr). Inferring ages through activity-rotation-age relations accounts for some color-dependent effects and systematically improves the age estimates (albeit only slightly). We demonstrate that coronal activity as measured through the fractional X-ray luminosity (RX=LX/Lbol) has nearly the same age- and rotation-inferring capability as chromospheric activity measured through R'HK. As a first application of our calibrations, we provide new activity-derived age estimates for a volume-limited sample of the 108 solar-type field dwarfs within 16 pc.},

	Abstract = {We use asteroseismic data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission to estimate the fundamental properties of more than 500 main-sequence and sub-giant stars. Data obtained during the first 10 months of Kepler science operations were used for this work, when these solar-type targets were observed for one month each in survey mode. Stellar properties have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters and complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Homogeneous sets of effective temperatures, T eff, were available for the entire ensemble from complementary photometry; spectroscopic estimates of T eff and [Fe/H] were available from a homogeneous analysis of ground-based data on a subset of 87 stars. We adopt a grid-based analysis, coupling six pipeline codes to 11 stellar evolutionary grids. Through use of these different grid-pipeline combinations we allow implicitly for the impact on the results of stellar model dependencies from commonly used grids, and differences in adopted pipeline methodologies. By using just two global parameters as the seismic inputs we are able to perform a homogenous analysis of all solar-type stars in the asteroseismic cohort, including many targets for which it would not be possible to provide robust estimates of individual oscillation frequencies (due to a combination of low signal-to-noise ratio and short dataset lengths). The median final quoted uncertainties from consolidation of the grid-based analyses are for the full ensemble (spectroscopic subset) approximately 10.8% (5.4%) in mass, 4.4% (2.2%) in radius, 0.017 dex (0.010 dex) in log g, and 4.3% (2.8%) in mean density. Around 36% (57%) of the stars have final age uncertainties smaller than 1 Gyr. These ages will be useful for ensemble studies, but should be treated carefully on a star-by-star basis. Future analyses using individual oscillation frequencies will offer significant improvements on up to 150 stars, in particular for estimates of the ages, where having the individual frequency data is most important.},

	Abstract = {ROSAT X-ray (PSPC) and EUV (WFC) observations of a sample of 12 nearby Halo and Old-Disk low mass stars have been analyzed to determine their emission levels, properties of their coronal spectra and to characterize their temporal variations on time scales from hours to ten years. The light curves of the old-disk stars of our sample with the highest count statistics, show that variability of a factor two on a time scale of a few thousands of seconds is a common property of old-disk stars. The coronal emission of GJ 191, the only halo star with enough counts to make the time analysis feasible, shows significant variations on a time scale of six months. The time resolved spectral analysis of the most intense stars shows that their coronal emission is consistent with a two temperature model with (approximately) constant values of the temperatures along the entire observation, while the observed variability can be explained by changes in their emission measure distributions. We find that the emission measures of the two components change coherently during the observations. For all ten detected stars we have computed hardness ratio and X-ray luminosity. While our old-disk stars fit well in the body of the distribution outlined by a complete volume limited sample of dM and dK stars within 7pc (Schmitt et al. 1995), the halo stars tend to occupy the softest and weakest envelope defined by population I low-mass stars.},

We show that the majority of our sample stars are on the main sequence, with only =~20% being giants.

	Abstract = {The most powerful explosions on the Sun - in the form of bright flares, intense storms of solar energetic particles (SEPs), and fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - drive the most severe space-weather storms. Proxy records of flare energies based on SEPs in principle may offer the longest time base to study infrequent large events. We conclude that one suggested proxy, nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores, does not map reliably to SEP events. Concentrations of select radionuclides measured in natural archives may prove useful in extending the time interval of direct observations up to ten millennia, but as their calibration to solar flare fluences depends on multiple poorly known properties and processes, these proxies cannot presently be used to help determine the flare energy frequency distribution. Being thus limited to the use of direct flare observations, we evaluate the probabilities of large-energy solar events by combining solar flare observations with an ensemble of stellar flare observations. We conclude that solar flare energies form a relatively smooth distribution from small events to large flares, while flares on magnetically active, young Sun-like stars have energies and frequencies markedly in excess of strong solar flares, even after an empirical scaling with the mean coronal activity level of these stars. In order to empirically quantify the frequency of uncommonly large solar flares extensive surveys of stars of near-solar age need to be obtained, such as is feasible with the Kepler satellite. Because the likelihood of flares larger than approximately X30 remains empirically unconstrained, we present indirect arguments, based on records of sunspots and on statistical arguments, that solar flares in the past four centuries have likely not substantially exceeded the level of the largest flares observed in the space era, and that there is at most about a 10% chance of a flare larger than about X30 in the next 30 years.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the relative role of EUV and X-ray radiation in the heating of hydrogen-rich planet atmospheres with different composition and electron content.  Methods: An accurate photo-ionization model has been used to follow the primary photo-electron energy deposition throughout the atmosphere.  Results: Heating rates and efficiencies have been computed, together with column density cut-offs at which photons of given energies stop their heating production inside the atmosphere. Assuming 100 eV as the energy borderline between the extreme ultraviolet spectral range and X-rays we find that when the absorbing hydrogen column density is higher than 1020 cm-2 only X-rays can heat the gas. Extreme ultraviolet photons heat the upper atmospheric layers.  Conclusions: Using emission spectra from a sample of solar-type stars of different ages representative of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, we have derived the corresponding heating rates. We find that the existence of an energetic cross-over in atmospheric heating is present for all stars in the sample.},

	Abstract = {Context. The current distribution of planet mass vs. incident stellar X-ray flux supports the idea that photoevaporation of the atmosphere may take place in close-in planets. Integrated effects have to be accounted for. A proper calculation of the mass loss rate through photoevaporation requires the estimation of the total irradiation from the whole XUV (X-rays and extreme ultraviolet, EUV) range.  Aims: The purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of the photoevaporation in planetary atmospheres from the accessible X-rays to the mostly unobserved EUV range by using the coronal models of stars to calculate the EUV contribution to the stellar spectra. The mass evolution of planets can be traced assuming that thermal losses dominate the mass loss of their atmospheres.  Methods: We determine coronal models for 82 stars with exoplanets that have X-ray observations available. Then a synthetic spectrum is produced for the whole XUV range (~1-912 {\AA}). The determination of the EUV stellar flux, calibrated with real EUV data, allows us to calculate the accumulated effects of the XUV irradiation on the planet atmosphere with time, as well as the mass evolution for planets with known density.  Results: We calibrate for the first time a relation of the EUV luminosity with stellar age valid for late-type stars. In a sample of 109 exoplanets, few planets with masses larger than ~1.5 MJ receive high XUV flux, suggesting that intense photoevaporation takes place in a short period of time, as previously found in X-rays. The scenario is also consistent with the observed distribution of planet masses with density. The accumulated effects of photoevaporation over time indicate that HD 209458b may have lost 0.2 MJ since an age of 20 Myr.  Conclusions: Coronal radiation produces rapid photoevaporation of the atmospheres of planets close to young late-type stars. More complex models are needed to explain the observations fully. Spectral energy distributions in the XUV range are made available for stars in the sample through the Virtual Observatory for the use in future planet atmospheric models.

	Abstract = {Aims: We re-examine the scenario of X-ray emission from magnetically confined/channeled wind shocks (MCWS) for Ap/Bp stars, a model originally developed to explain the ROSAT detection of the A0p star IQ Aur.  Methods: We present new X-ray observations of the A0p stars alpha2 CVn (Chandra) and IQ Aur (XMM-Newton) and discuss our findings in the context of X-ray generating mechanisms of magnetic, chemically peculiar intermediate mass stars.  Results: The X-ray luminosities of IQ Aur with log LX = 29.6 erg s-1 and alpha2 CVn with log LX ≲ 26.0 erg s-1 differ by at least three orders of magnitude, although both are A0p stars. By studying a sample of comparison stars, we find that X-ray emission is preferably generated by more massive objects such as IQ Aur. Besides a strong, cool plasma component, significant amounts of hot (>10 MK) plasma are present during the quasi-quiescent phase of IQ Aur; moreover, diagnostics of the UV sensitive f/i line ratio in He-like O vii triplet point to X-ray emitting regions well above the stellar surface of IQ Aur. In addition we detect a large flare from IQ Aur with temperatures up to ~100 MK and a peak X-ray luminosity of log LX ≈ 31.5 erg s-1. The flare, showing a fast rise and e-folding decay time of less than half an hour, originates in a fairly compact structure and is accompanied by a significant metallicity increase. The X-ray properties of IQ Aur cannot be described by wind shocks only and require the presence of magnetic reconnection. This is most evident in the, to our knowledge, first X-ray flare reported from an A0p star.  Conclusions: Our study indicates that the occurrence the of X-ray emission in A0p stars generated by magnetically channeled wind shocks depends on stellar properties such as luminosity, which promote a high mass loss rate, whereas magnetic field configuration and transient phenomena refine their appearance. While we cannot rule out unknown close companions, the X-ray emission from IQ Aur can be described consistently in the MCWS scenario, in which the very strong magnetic confinement of the stellar wind has led to the build-up of a rigidly rotating disk around the star, where magnetic reconnection and centrifugal breakout events occur.},

	Abstract = {Context. IC 348 is a nearby ( ≈ 310 pc), young (~2-3 Myr) open cluster with >300 members identified from optical and infrared observations. It comprises young stellar objects in various evolutionary phases from protostars over disk-bearing to diskless pre-main sequence stars. This gives us the opportunity to study evolutionary effects in the high-energy emissions in a homogeneous environment.  Aims: We study the properties of the coronae of the young low-mass stars in IC 348 combining X-ray and optical/infrared data. In particular, we intend to shed light on the dependence of X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness on evolutionary stage and on stellar parameters such as mass, effective temperature, and bolometric luminosity.  Methods: The four existing Chandra observations of IC 348 were merged, thus providing a deeper and spatially more complete X-ray view than previous X-ray studies of the cluster. We have compiled a comprehensive catalog of IC 348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. Our data collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excess indicating the presence of disks, Halpha emission as a tracer of chromospheric emission or accretion, and mass accretion rates.  Results: We have detected 290 X-ray sources in four merged Chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated with known cluster members, which corresponds to a detection rate of ~60% for the cluster members of IC 348 that are identified in optical/infrared studies. According to the most recent spectral classification of IC 348 members, only four of the X-ray sources are brown dwarfs (spectral type M6 and later). The detection rate is highest for diskless Class III stars and increases with stellar mass. This may be explained with higher X-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evident in the X-ray luminosity functions. In particular, we find that for the lowest examined masses (0.1-0.25 M&sun;) there is a difference between the X-ray luminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on the basis of their Halpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing and diskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energy distribution). These differences disappear for higher masses. This is related to our finding that the Lx/Lbol ratio is non-constant across the mass/luminosity sequence of IC 348 with a decrease toward lower luminosity stars. Our analysis of an analogous stellar sample in the Orion Nebula Cluster suggests that the decline of Lx/Lbol for young stars at the low-mass end of the stellar sequence is likely universal.

	Abstract = {Context. Several diagnostics ranging from the radio to the X-ray band are suitable for investigating the magnetic activity of late-type stars. Empirical connections between the emission at different wavelengths place constraints on the nature and efficiency of the emission mechanism and the physical conditions in different atmospheric layers. The activity of ultracool dwarfs, at the low-mass end of the main-sequence, is poorly understood.  Aims: We perform a multi-wavelength study of one of the nearest M9 dwarfs, DENIS-P J104814.7-395606 (4 pc), to examine its position within the group of magnetically active ultracool dwarfs, and, in general, advance our understanding of these objects by comparing them to early-M type dwarf stars and the Sun.  Methods: We obtained an XMM-Newton observation of DENIS-P J104814.7-395606 and a broad-band spectrum from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared with X-Shooter. From this dataset, we derive the X-ray properties, stellar parameters, kinematics, and the emission-line spectrum tracing chromospheric activity. We integrate these data by compiling the activity parameters of ultracool dwarfs from the literature.  Results: Our deep XMM-Newton observation provides the first X-ray detection of DENIS-P J104814.7-395606 (log Lx = 25.1), as well as the first measurement of its V band brightness (V = 17.35 mag). The flux-flux relations between X-ray and chromospheric activity indicators are here for the first time extended into the regime of the ultracool dwarfs. The approximate agreement of DENIS-P J104814.7-395606 and other ultracool dwarfs with flux-flux relations for early-M dwarfs suggests that the same heating mechanisms work in the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs, albeit weaker as judged from their lower fluxes. The observed Balmer decrements of DENIS 1048-3956 are compatible with optically thick plasma in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) at low, nearly photospheric temperature or optically thin LTE plasma at 20 000 K. Describing the decrements with case B recombination requires different emitting regions for Halpha and the higher Balmer lines. The high observed Halpha/Hbeta flux ratio is also poorly fitted by the optically thin models. We derive a similarly high value for the Halpha/Hbeta ratio of vB 10 and LHS 2065 and conclude that this may be a characteristic of ultracool dwarfs. We add DENIS-P J104814.7-395606 to the list of ultracool dwarfs detected in both the radio and the X-ray band. The Benz-G{\"u}del relation between radio and X-ray luminosity of late-type stars is well-known to be violated by ultracool dwarfs.

	Abstract = {M dwarfs are the most numerous stars in the Galaxy. They are characterized by strong magnetic activity. The ensuing high-energy emission is crucial for the evolution of their planets and the eventual presence of life on them. We systematically study the X-ray and ultraviolet emission of a subsample of M dwarfs from a recent proper-motion survey, selecting all M dwarfs within 10 pc to obtain a nearly volume-limited sample (˜90 per cent completeness). Archival ROSAT, XMM-Newton and GALEX data are combined with published spectroscopic studies of Halpha emission and rotation to obtain a broad picture of stellar activity on M dwarfs. We make use of synthetic model spectra to determine the relative contributions of photospheric and chromospheric emission to the ultraviolet flux. We also analyse the same diagnostics for a comparison sample of young M dwarfs in the TW Hya association (˜10 Myr). We find that generally the emission in the GALEX bands is dominated by the chromosphere but the photospheric component is not negligible in early-M field dwarfs. The surface fluxes for the Halpha, near-ultraviolet, far-ultraviolet and X-ray emission are connected via a power-law dependence. We present here for the first time such flux-flux relations involving broad-band ultraviolet emission for M dwarfs. Activity indices are defined as flux ratio between the activity diagnostic and the bolometric flux of the star in analogy to the Ca II R'HK index. For given spectral type, these indices display a spread of 2-3 dex which is largest for M4 stars. Strikingly, at mid-M spectral types, the spread of rotation rates is also at its highest level. The mean activity index for fast rotators, likely representing the saturation level, decreases from X-rays over the FUV to the NUV band and Halpha, i.e. the fractional radiation output increases with atmospheric height. The comparison to the ultraviolet and X-ray properties of TW Hya members shows a drop of nearly three orders of magnitude for the luminosity in these bands between ˜10 Myr and few Gyr age. A few young field dwarfs (<1 Gyr) in the 10-pc sample bridge the gap indicating that the drop in magnetic activity with age is a continuous process. The slope of the age decay is steeper for the X-ray than for the UV luminosity.},

	Abstract = {We interpret the X-ray light curve obtained by XMM-Newton during a total X-ray eclipse in the nearby binary star alpha  Coronae Borealis. This system consists of a G5 V main-sequence star orbiting an X-ray dark A0 star. The secondary G star is a young, active solar analog with an age of a few 100 Myr. As the primary A star eclipses active regions on the X-ray bright companion, the light curve drops in consecutive steps to zero; as individual active regions reappear during egress, the flux rises in similar steps. The ingress and egress light curves are combined to reconstruct the 2D distribution of X-ray brightness on and around the G star. Three different methods are applied, and variations due to statistical noise and uncertainties in the binary system parameters are discussed. Although the solutions are non-unique, all reconstructions reveal a similar distribution of X-ray bright regions and large areas with little flux. We present plausible estimates of (lower limits to) the electron densities in the bright regions, obtaining characteristic values between 109-3x 1010 cm-3.  Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).},

	Abstract = {The Milky Way's most luminous, young, and massive (M gsim 104 M &sun;) star clusters and OB associations have largely evaded detection despite knowledge of their surrounding H II regions. We search for these clusters and associations within the 40 star-forming complexes from Rahman & Murray in the 13 most luminous Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) free-free emission sources of the Galaxy. Selecting for objects with the dust-reddened colors of OB stars, we identify new candidate associations using the Two Micron All Sky Survey point-source catalog. In 40 star-forming complexes searched, 22 contain cluster/association candidates with sizes and masses in the range of 3'-26' and 102.3-105 M &sun;. Of the 22 candidates, at least seven have estimated masses >~ 104 M &sun;, doubling the number of such massive clusters known in the Galaxy. Only one of the searched WMAP sources remains without a candidate. Applying our method to a statistically similar set of test locations, we estimate that 3.0 $\pm$ 0.6 of our 22 candidate associations are unrelated to the star-forming complexes. In addition, the apparent extinctions of our candidate associations correlate well with the predictions from a Galactic model. These facts, along with the clear detection of a known OB association and the previous spectral verification of one cluster found by this method, validate our method. In eight of the most luminous WMAP sources, the candidate associations can account for the observed free-free flux. With our new compilation, the Galactic census of young, massive stellar associations may now be about half complete.},

	Abstract = {Open clusters are collections of stars with a single, well-determined age, and can be used to investigate the connections between angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime. We present the results of a comparative study of the relationship between stellar rotation and activity in two benchmark open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at $\approx$600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of 720 spectra --- more than half of which are new observations --- for 516 high-confidence members of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for 130 high-confidence Hyads. We have collected rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for 135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare $H\alpha$ emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, as a function of color, mass, and Rossby number $R_o$, we first calculate an expanded set of $\chi$ values, with which we can obtain the $H\alpha$ to bolometric luminosity ratio, $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$, even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable distances. Our $\chi$ values cover a broader range of stellar masses and colors (roughly equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit better agreement between independent calculations, than existing values. We find no difference between the two clusters in their $H\alpha$ equivalent width or $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$ distributions, and therefore take the merged $H\alpha$ and $P_{rot}$ data to be representative of 600-Myr-old stars. Our analysis shows that $H\alpha$ activity in these stars is saturated for $R_o\leq0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. Above that value activity declines as a power-law with slope $\beta=-0.73^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$, before dropping off rapidly at $R_o\approx0.4$...},

	Abstract = {The frequency of disks around young stars, a key parameter for understanding planet formation, is most readily determined in young stellar clusters where many relatively coeval stars are located in close proximity. Observational studies seem to show that the disk frequency decreases rapidly with cluster age with <10% of cluster stars retaining their disks for longer than 2-6 Myr. Given that at least half of all stars in the field seem to harbor one or more planets, this would imply extremely fast disk dispersal and rapid planet growth. Here we question the validity of this constraint by demonstrating that the short disk dissipation times inferred to date might have been heavily underestimated by selection effects. Critically, for ages >3 Myr only stars that originally populated the densest areas of very populous clusters, which are prone to disk erosion, are actually considered. This tiny sample may not be representative of the majority of stars. In fact, the higher disk fractions in co-moving groups indicate that it is likely that over 30% of all field stars retain their disks well beyond 10 Myr, leaving ample time for planet growth. Equally, our solar system, with a likely formation time >10 Myr, need no longer be an exception but in fact typical of planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We use Herschel PACS observations at 70 and 160$\mu$m to probe the protoplanetary disks around young stars in the CepOB2 clusters Tr37 and NGC7160 and to trace the small-scale cloud structure. We detect 95 protoplanetary disks at 70$\mu$m, 41 at 160$\mu$m, and obtain upper limits for over 130 objects. The detection fraction at 70$\mu$m depends on the spectral type (88% for K4 or earlier, 17% for M3 or later stars) and on the disk type ($\sim$50% for full and pre-transitional disks, $\sim$35% for transitional disks, no low-excess/depleted disks detected). Non-accreting disks are consistent with significantly lower masses. Accreting transition and pre-transition disks have higher 70$\mu$m excesses than full disks, suggestive of more massive, flared and/or thicker disks. Herschel data also reveal several mini-clusters in Tr37, small, compact structures containing a few young stars surrounded by nebulosity. Far-IR data are an excellent probe of the evolution of disks that are too faint for submillimetre observations. We find a strong link between far-IR emission and accretion, and between the inner and outer disk structure. Herschel confirms the dichotomy between accreting and non-accreting transition disks. Substantial mass depletion and global evolution need to occur to shut down accretion in a protoplanetary disk, even if the disk has inner holes. Disks likely follow different evolutionary paths: Low disk masses do not imply opening inner holes, and having inner holes does not require low disk masses. The mini-clusters reveal multi-episodic star formation in Tr37. The long survival of mini-clusters suggest that they formed from the fragmentation of the same core. Their various morphologies favour different formation/triggering mechanisms acting within the same cluster. Herschel also unveils what could be the first heavy mass loss episode of the O6.5 star HD206267.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of X-ray emission from accretion shocks in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), generated where the infalling material impacts the stellar surface. Both observations and models of the accretion process reveal several aspects that are still unclear: the observed X-ray luminosity in accretion shocks is below the predicted value, and the density versus temperature structure of the shocked plasma, with increasing densities at higher temperature, deduced from the observations, is at odds with that proposed in the current picture of accretion shocks. To address these open issues we investigate whether a correct treatment of the local absorption by the surrounding medium is crucial to explain the observations. To this end, we describe the impact of an accretion stream on a CTTS by considering a magnetohydrodynamic model. From the model results we synthesize the X-ray emission from the accretion shock by producing maps and spectra. We perform density and temperature diagnostics on the synthetic spectra, and we directly compare the results with the observations. Our model shows that the X-ray fluxes inferred from the emerging spectra are lower than expected because of the complex local absorption by the optically thick material of the chromosphere and of the unperturbed stream. Moreover, our model including the effects of local absorption explains in a natural way the apparently puzzling pattern of density versus temperature observed in the X-ray emission from accretion shocks.},

@article{ada11a,
	Abstract = {Young stars typically have strong magnetic fields, so that the magnetospheres of newly formed close binaries can interact, dissipate energy, and produce synchrotron radiation. The V773 Tau A binary system, a pair of T Tauri stars with a 51 day orbit, displays such a signature, with peak emission taking place near periastron. This paper proposes that the observed emission arises from the change in energy stored in the composite magnetic field of the system. We model the fields using the leading order (dipole) components and show that this picture is consistent with current observations. In this model, the observed radiation accounts for a fraction of the available energy of interaction between the magnetic fields from the two stars. Assuming antisymmetry, we compute the interaction energy E int as a function of the stellar radii, the stellar magnetic field strengths, the binary semimajor axis, and orbital eccentricity, all of which can be measured independently of the synchrotron radiation. The variability in time and energetics of the synchrotron radiation depend on the details of the annihilation of magnetic fields through reconnection events, which generate electric fields that accelerate charged particles, and how those charged particles, especially fast electrons, are removed from the interaction region. However, the major qualitative features are well described by the background changes in the global magnetic configuration driven by the orbital motion. The theory can be tested by observing a collection of pre-main-sequence binary systems.},

	Abstract = {Context. The ultraluminous infrared galaxy Mrk 231, which shows signs of both black hole accretion and star formation, exhibits very strong water rotational lines between lambda = 200-670 mum, comparable to the strength of the CO rotational lines. High-redshift quasars also show similar CO and H2O line properties, while starburst galaxies, such as M 82, lack these very strong H2O lines in the same wavelength range, but do show strong CO lines.  Aims: We explore the possibility of enhancing the gas phase H2O abundance in X-ray exposed environments, using bare interstellar carbonaceous dust grains as a catalyst. Cloud-cloud collisions cause C and J shocks, and strip the grains of their ice layers. The internal UV field created by X-rays from the accreting black hole does not allow reforming the ice.  Methods: We determined the formation rates of both OH and H2O on dust grains, with temperatures Tdust = 10-60 K, using both Monte Carlo and rate equation method simulations. The acquired formation rates were added to our X-ray chemistry code, which allowed us to calculate the thermal and chemical structure of the interstellar medium near an active galactic nucleus.  Results: We derive analytic expressions for the formation of OH and H2O on bare dust grains as a catalyst. Oxygen atoms arriving on the dust are released into the gas phase in the form of OH and H2O. The efficiencies of this conversion due to the chemistry occurring on dust are near 30 percent for oxygen converted into OH and 60 percent for oxygen converted into H2O between Tdust = 15-40 K. At higher temperatures, the efficiencies decline rapidly. When the gas is mostly atomic, molecule formation on dust is dominant over the gas-phase route, which is then quenched by the low H2 abundance. Here, it is possible to enhance the warm (T > 200 K) water abundance by an order of magnitude in X-ray exposed environments. This helps explain the observed bright water lines in nearby and high-redshift ULIRGs and quasars.},

The density structure and chemical composition of protoplanetary disks are affected by the incident radiation field at optical, far-ultraviolet (FUV), and X-ray wavelengths, as well as by the dust properties.  Aims: The effect of FUV and X-rays on the disk structure and the gas chemical composition are investigated. This work forms the basis of a second paper, which discusses the impact on diagnostic lines of, e.g., C+, O, H2O, and Ne+ observed with facilities such as Spitzer and Herschel.  Methods: A grid of 240 models is computed in which the X-ray and FUV luminosity, minimum grain size, dust size distribution, and surface density distribution are varied in a systematic way. The hydrostatic structure and the thermo-chemical structure are calculated using Protoplanetary Disk Model (ProDiMo), with the recent addition of X-rays.  Results: The abundance structure of neutral oxygen is very stable to changes in the X-ray and FUV luminosity, and the emission lines will thus be useful tracers of the disk mass and temperature. The C+ abundance distribution is sensitive to both X-rays and FUV. The radial column density profile shows two peaks, one at the inner rim and a second one at a radius r = 5-10 AU. The minimum is caused by shadowing from the inner rim. The fluctuations in value of the column density as a function of radius are smoothed out when FUV and X-ray luminosities increase. Ne+ and other heavy elements with an ionization potential higher than IP > 13.6 eV have a very strong response to X-rays, and the column density in the inner disk increases by two orders of magnitude from the lowest (LX = 1029 erg s-1) to the highest considered X-ray flux (LX = 1032 erg s-1). FUV confines the Ne+ ionized region to areas closer to the star at low X-ray luminosities (LX = 1029 erg s-1). This is indirectly caused by changes in the disk structure. The radial column densities of Ne+ are higher than 1012 cm-1 out to radii r > 100 AU (at LFUV >= 1031 erg s-1), whereas the column density already drops below this value at radii r > 20 AU at LFUV = 1032 erg s-1. H2O abundances are enhanced by X-rays due to higher temperatures in the inner disk than in the FUV only case, thus leading to a more efficient neutral-neutral formation channel. Also, the higher ionization fraction provides an ion-molecule route in the outer disk. The line fluxes and profiles are affected by the effects on these species, thus providing diagnostic value in the study of FUV and X-ray irradiated disks around T Tauri stars.

	Abstract = {Context. Most of the mass in protoplanetary disks is in the form of gas. The study of the gas and its diagnostics is of fundamental importance in order to achieve a detailed description of the thermal and chemical structure of the disk. Both radiation from the central star (from optical to X-ray wavelengths) and viscous accretion are the main sources of energy, dominating disk physics and chemistry in its early stages. This is the environment in which the first phases of planet formation will proceed.  Aims: We investigate how stellar and disk parameters impact the fine-structure cooling lines [Ne ii], [Ar ii], [O i], [C ii], and H2O rotational lines in the disk. These lines are potentially powerful diagnostics of the disk structure, and their modeling permits a thorough interpretation of the observations carried out with instrumental facilities such as Spitzer and Herschel.  Methods: Following our earlier paper, we computed a grid of 240 disk models, in which the X-ray luminosity, UV-excess luminosity, minimum dust grain size, dust size distribution power law, and surface density distribution power law are systematically varied. We solve self-consistently for the disk vertical hydrostatic structure in every model and apply detailed line radiative transfer to calculate line fluxes and profiles for a series of well-known mid- and far-infrared cooling lines.  Results: The [O i] 63 mum line flux increases with increasing LFUV when LX < 1030 erg s-1 and with increasing X-ray luminosity when LX > 1030 erg s-1. While [C ii] 157 mum is mainly driven by LFUV via C+ production, X-rays affect the line flux to a lesser extent. In addition, [Ne ii] 12.8 mum correlates with X-rays; the line profile emitted from the disk atmosphere shows a double-peaked component caused by emission in the static disk atmosphere, next to a high-velocity double-peaked component caused by emission in the very inner rim. Water transitions, depending on the disk region they arise from, show different slopes in correlation with the [O i] 63 mum line.},

@article{jac14a,
	Abstract = {In a coeval group of low-mass stars, the luminosity of the sharp transition between stars that retain their initial lithium and those at slightly higher masses in which Li has been depleted by nuclear reactions, the lithium depletion boundary (LDB), has been advanced as an almost model-independent means of establishing an age scale for young stars. Here we construct polytropic models of contracting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) that have cool, magnetic starspots blocking a fraction $\beta$ of their photospheric flux. Starspots slow the descent along Hayashi tracks, leading to lower core temperatures and less Li destruction at a given mass and age. The age, $\tau_{\rm LDB}$, determined from the luminosity of the LDB, $L_{\rm LDB}$, is increased by a factor $(1-\beta)^{-E}$ compared to that inferred from unspotted models, where $E \simeq 1 + d\log \tau_{\rm LDB}/d \log L_{\rm LDB}$ and has a value $\sim 0.5$ at ages $< 80$ Myr, decreasing to $\sim 0.3$ for older stars. Spotted stars have virtually the same relationship between K-band bolometric correction and colour as unspotted stars, so this relationship applies equally to ages inferred from the absolute K magnitude of the LDB. Low-mass PMS stars do have starspots, but the appropriate value of $\beta$ is highly uncertain with a probable range of $0.1 < \beta < 0.4$. For the smaller $\beta$ values our result suggests a modest systematic increase in LDB ages that is comparable with the maximum levels of theoretical uncertainty previously claimed for the technique. The largest $\beta$ values would however increase LDB ages by 20-30 per cent and demand a re-evaluation of other age estimation techniques calibrated using LDB ages.},

	Abstract = {As part of the POISSON project (Protostellar Optical-Infrared Spectral Survey on NTT), we present the results of the analysis of low-resolution NIR spectra 0.9-2.4 um) of two samples of YSOs in Lupus and Serpens (52 and 17 objects), with masses 0.1-2.0 Msun and ages from 10^5 to a few 10^7 yr. After determining the accretion parameters of the Lup and Ser targets by analysing their HI near-IR emission features, we added the results to those from previous regions (investigated in POISSON with the same methodology). We obtained a final catalogue (143 objects) of mass accretion rates (Macc) derived in a homogeneous fashion and analysed how Macc correlates with M* and how it evolves in time. We derived the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and Macc for Lup and Ser objects from the Br_gamma line by using relevant empirical relationships from the literature that connect HI line luminosity and Lacc. To minimise the biases and also for self-consistency, we re-derived mass and age for each source using the same set of evolutionary tracks. We observe a correlation MaccM*^2.2, similarly to what has previously been observed in several star-forming clouds. The time variation of Macc is roughly consistent with the expected evolution in viscous disks, with an asymptotic decay that behaves as t^-1.6. However, Macc values are characterised by a large scatter at similar ages and are on average higher than the predictions of viscous models. Although part of the scattering may be related to the employed empirical relationship and to uncertainties on the single measurements, the general distribution and decay trend of the Macc points are real. These findings might be indicative of a large variation in the initial mass of the disks, of fairly different viscous laws among disks, of varying accretion regimes, and of other mechanisms that add to the dissipation of the disks, such as photo-evaporation.},

	Abstract = {We present velocity-resolved spectroastrometric imaging of the 4.7 mum rovibrational lines of CO gas in protoplanetary disks using the CRIRES high-resolution infrared spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The method as applied to three disks with known dust gaps or inner holes out to 4-45 AU (SR 21, HD 135344B, and TW Hya) achieves an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.1-0.5 AU. While one possible gap formation mechanism is dynamical clearing by giant planets, other equally good explanations (stellar companions, grain growth, photoevaporation) exist. One way of distinguishing between different scenarios is the presence and distribution of gas inside the dust gaps. Keplerian disk models are fit to the spectroastrometric position-velocity curves to derive geometrical parameters of the molecular gas. We determine the position angles and inclinations of the inner disks with accuracies as good as 1$\,^{\circ}$-2$\,^{\circ}$, as well as the radial extent of the gas emission. Molecular gas is detected well inside the dust gaps in all three disks. The gas emission extends to within a radius of 0.5 AU for HD 135344B and to 0.1 AU for TW Hya, supporting partial clearing by a <1-10 MJup planetary body as the cause of the observed dust gaps, or removal of the dust by extensive grain coagulation and planetesimal formation. The molecular gas emission in SR 21 appears to be truncated within ~7 AU, which may be caused by complete dynamical clearing by a more massive companion. We find a smaller inclination angle of the inner disk of TW Hya than that determined for the outer disk, suggestive of a disk warp. We also detect significant azimuthal asymmetries in the SR 21 and HD 135344B inner disks.  This work is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope under program ID 179.C-0151.},

To address this problem, we have obtained near-IR spectroscopy of the nearby, close binary T Tauri system V4046 Sgr AB with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SPEX spectrometer. The V4046 Sgr close binary (and circumbinary disk) system provides an important test case for spectral type determination thanks to the stringent observational constraints on its component stellar masses (i.e., ~0.9 Msun each) as well as on its age (12-21 Myr) and distance (73 pc). Analysis of the IRTF data indicates that the composite near-IR spectral type for V4046 Sgr AB lies in the range M0-M1, i.e., significantly later than the K5+K7 composite type previously determined from optical spectroscopy. However, the K5+K7 composite type is in better agreement with theoretical pre-MS evolutionary tracks, given the well-determined properties of V4046 Sgr AB. These results serve as a cautionary tale for studies that rely on near-infrared spectroscopy as a primary means to infer the ages and masses of pre-MS stars.},

	Abstract = {Photoevaporation due to high-energy stellar photons is thought to be one of the main drivers of protoplanetary disk dispersal. The fully or partially ionized disk surface is expected to produce free-free continuum emission at centimeter (cm) wavelengths that can be routinely detected with interferometers such as the upgraded Very Large Array (VLA). We use deep (rms noise down to 8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the field of view center) 3.5 cm maps of the nearby (130 pc) Corona Australis (CrA) star formation (SF) region to constrain disk photoevaporation models. We find that the radio emission from disk sources in CrA is surprisingly faint. Only 3 out of 10 sources within the field of view are detected, with flux densities of order $10^2$ $\mu$Jy. However, a significant fraction of their emission is non-thermal. Typical upper limits for non-detections are $3\sigma\sim 60~\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Assuming analytic expressions for the free-free emission from extreme-UV (EUV) irradiation, we derive stringent upper limits to the ionizing photon luminosity impinging on the disk surface $\Phi_\mathrm{EUV}<1-4\times10^{41}$ s$^{-1}$. These limits constrain $\Phi_\mathrm{EUV}$ to the low end of the values needed by EUV-driven photoevaporation models to clear protoplanetary disks in the observed few Myr timescale. Therefore, at least in CrA, EUV-driven photoevaporation is not likely to be the main agent of disk dispersal. We also compare the observed X-ray luminosities $L_X$ of disk sources with models in which photoevaporation is driven by such photons. Although predictions are less specific than for the EUV case, most of the observed fluxes (upper limits) are roughly consistent with the (scaled) predictions. Deeper observations, as well as predictions spanning a wider parameter space, are needed to properly test X-ray driven photoevaporation.},

This continuum has been poorly observed but energetically dominates the radiant energy output . Recent bolometric observations of solar flares furthermore point to the impulsive phase as the source of a major fraction of the radiant energy. This component appears to exhibit a Balmer jump and thus must originate in an optically thin region above the quiet photosphere, with an elevated temperature and strong ionization.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We conducted the first X-ray observations of the newly erupting FU~Ori-type outburst in HBC~722 (V2493 Cyg) with the aim to characterize its X-ray behavior and near-stellar environment during early outburst. Methods: We used data from the \XMM\ and \CXO\ X-ray observatories to measure X-ray source temperatures and luminosities as well as the gas column densities along the line of sight toward the source. Results: We report a \CXO\ X-ray detection of HBC~722 with an X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 4\times 10^{30}~\mathrm{ergs~s}^{-1}$. The gas column density exceeds values expected from optical extinction and standard gas-to-dust ratios. We conclude that dust-free gas masses are present around the star, such as strong winds launched from the inner disk, or massive accretion columns. A tentative detection obtained by \XMM\ two years earlier after an initial optical peak revealed a fainter X-ray source with only weak absorption.},

	Abstract = {The described investigation is concerned with the solution of the non-LTE optically thick transfer equations for hydrogen, carbon, and other constituents to determine semiempirical models for six components of the quiet solar chromosphere. For a given temperature-height distribution, the solution is obtained of the equations of statistical equilibrium, radiative transfer for lines and continua, and hydrostatic equilibrium to find the ionization and excitation conditions for each atomic constituent. The emergent spectrum is calculated, and a trial and error approach is used to adjust the temperature distribution so that the emergent spectrum is in best agreement with the observed one. The relationship between semiempirical models determined in this way and theoretical models based on radiative equilibrium is discussed by Avrett (1977). Harvard Skylab EUV observations are used to determine models for a number of quiet-sun regions.},

	Abstract = {This article broadly reviews our knowledge of solar flares. There is a particular focus on their global properties, as opposed to the microphysics such as that needed for magnetic reconnection or particle acceleration as such. Indeed solar flares will always remain in the domain of remote sensing, so we cannot observe the microscales directly and must understand the basic physics entirely via the global properties plus theoretical inference. The global observables include the general energetics---radiation in flares and mass loss in coronal mass ejections (CMEs)---and the formation of different kinds of ejection and global wave disturbance: the type II radio-burst exciter, the Moreton wave, the EIT "wave", and the "sunquake" acoustic waves in the solar interior. Flare radiation and CME kinetic energy can have comparable magnitudes, of order 1032 erg each for an X-class event, with the bulk of the radiant energy in the visible-UV continuum. We argue that the impulsive phase of the flare dominates the energetics of all of these manifestations, and also point out that energy and momentum in this phase largely reside in the electromagnetic field, not in the observable plasma.},

	Abstract = {Herbig Ae/Be stars lie in the mass range between low and high mass young stars, and therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe any changes in the formation processes that may occur across this boundary. This paper presents medium resolution VLT/X-Shooter spectra of six Herbig Ae/Be stars, drawn from a sample of 91 targets, and high resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra of five Herbig Ae/Be stars, chosen based on the presence of CO first overtone bandhead emission in their spectra. The X-Shooter survey reveals a low detection rate of CO first overtone emission (7 per cent), consisting of objects mainly of spectral type B. A positive correlation is found between the strength of the CO v=2-0 and Br {\gamma} emission lines, despite their intrinsic linewidths suggesting a separate kinematic origin. The high resolution CRIRES spectra are modelled, and are well fitted under the assumption that the emission originates from small scale Keplerian discs, interior to the dust sublimation radius, but outside the co-rotation radius of the central stars. In addition, our findings are in very good agreement for the one object where spatially resolved near-infrared interferometric studies have also been performed. These results suggest that the Herbig Ae/Be stars in question are in the process of gaining mass via disc accretion, and that modelling of high spectral resolution spectra is able to provide a reliable probe into the process of stellar accretion in young stars of intermediate to high masses.},

	Abstract = {Spectral data on a white light wave occurring during the explosive phase of the August 7 flare were obtained simultaneously with three telescopes at the Sacramento Peak Observatory. Spectrograms in the wavelength region from 3530 to 5895 A and sequences of filtergrams at 4950 and 5900 A constitute the most complete record of white light flare emission obtained to date. Analysis of the iron line spectrum and of the CN and CH molecular lines shows that the maximum depth of the emission in the flare wave is about 200 km above the photosphere of the Harvard-Smithsonian Reference Atmosphere. From the Balmer line analysis, it is concluded that, in agreement with Canfield (1974) and Shmeleva and Syrovatskii (1973), the flare occurs in a thin layer and that the heating and ionization of the flaring layers are due to the injection of 100 keV electrons. There is no need to postulate filamentary structure in the flaring layer in order to explain the observations.},

	Abstract = {Ellerman bombs and Type II white-light flares share many common features despite the large energy gap between them. Both are considered to result from local heating in the solar lower atmosphere. We present numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection occurring in such a deep atmosphere, with the aim to account for the common features of the two phenomena. Our numerical results manifest the following two typical characteristics of the assumed reconnection process: (1) magnetic reconnection saturates in ~600-900 s, which is just the lifetime of the two phenomena; (2) ionization in the upper chromosphere consumes quite a large part of the energy released through reconnection, making the heating effect most significant in the lower chromosphere. The application of the reconnection model to the two phenomena is discussed in detail.},

	Abstract = {In this topical review I revisit the ``chromospheric flare''.  This should currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone, but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways.  It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy -- in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation.  It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere.  The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems.},

	Abstract = {Observations over the past two solar cycles show a highly irregular pattern of occurrence for major solar flares, gamma-ray events, and solar energetic particle (SEP) fluences. Such phenomena do not appear to follow the direct indices of solar magnetic activity, such as the sunspot number. I show that this results from the non-Poisson occurrence for the most energetic events. This Letter also points out a particularly striking example of this irregularity in a comparison between the declining phases of the recent two solar cycles (1993-1995 and 2004-2006, respectively) and traces it through the radiated energies of the flares, the associated SEP fluences, and the sunspot areas. These factors suggest that processes in the solar interior involved with the supply of magnetic flux up to the surface of the Sun have strong correlations in space and time, leading to a complex occurrence pattern that is presently unpredictable on timescales longer than active region lifetimes (weeks) and not correlated well with the solar cycle itself.},

	Abstract = {Context. We study a sequence of eruptive events including filament eruption, a GOES C4.3 flare, and a coronal mass ejection.  Aims: We aim to identify the possible trigger(s) and precursor(s) of the filament destabilisation, investigate flare kernel characteristics, flare ribbons/kernels formation and evolution, study the interrelation of the filament-eruption/flare/coronal-mass-ejection phenomena as part of the integral active-region magnetic field configuration, and determine Halpha line profile evolution during the eruptive phenomena.  Methods: Multi-instrument observations are analysed including Halpha line profiles, speckle images at Halpha - 0.8 {\AA} and Halpha + 0.8 {\AA} from IBIS at DST/NSO, EUV images and magnetograms from the SDO, coronagraph images from STEREO, and the X-ray flux observations from Fermi and GOES.  Results: We establish that the filament destabilisation and eruption are the main triggers for the flaring activity. A surge-like event with a circular ribbon in one of the filament footpoints is determined as the possible trigger of the filament destabilisation. Plasma draining in this footpoint is identified as the precursor for the filament eruption. A magnetic flux emergence prior to the filament destabilisation followed by a high rate of flux cancellation of 1.34 × 1016 Mx s-1 is found during the flare activity. The flare X-ray lightcurves reveal three phases that are found to be associated with three different ribbons occurring consecutively. A kernel from each ribbon is selected and analysed. The kernel lightcurves and Halpha line profiles reveal that the emission increase in the line centre is stronger than that in the line wings. A delay of around 5-6 min is found between the increase in the line centre and the occurrence of red asymmetry. Only red asymmetry is observed in the ribbons during the impulsive phases. Blue asymmetry is only associated with the dynamic filament.  Appendix A and movie associated to Fig. A.4 are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {On 2012 June 17, we observed the evolution of a C-class flare associated with the eruption of a filament near a large sunspot in the active region NOAA 11504. We obtained high spatial resolution filtergrams using the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory in broadband TiO at 706 nm (bandpass: 10 {\AA}) and He I 10830 {\AA} narrow band (bandpass: 0.5 {\AA}, centered 0.25 {\AA} to the blue). We analyze the spatio-temporal behavior of the He I 10830 {\AA} data, which were obtained over a 90''×90'' field of view with a cadence of 10 s. We also analyze simultaneous data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment instruments on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager and GOES spacecrafts. Non-thermal effects are ignored in this analysis. Several quantitative aspects of the data, as well as models derived using the "0D" enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops model code, indicate that the triplet states of the 10830 {\AA} multiplet are populated by photoionization of chromospheric plasma followed by radiative recombination. Surprisingly, the He II 304 {\AA} line is reasonably well matched by standard emission measure calculations, along with the C IV emission which dominates the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly 1600 {\AA} channel during flares. This work lends support to some of our previous work combining X-ray, EUV, and UV data of flares to build models of energy transport from corona to chromosphere.},

	Abstract = {We address a possibility of the flare process initiation and further maintenance of its energy release due to a transformation of sunspot longitudinal waves into transverse magnetic loop oscillations with initiation of reconnection. This leads to heating maintaining after the energy release peak and formation of a flat stage on the X-ray profile. We applied the time-distance plots and pixel wavelet filtration (PWF) methods to obtain spatio-temporal distribution of wave power variations in SDO/AIA data. To find magnetic waveguides, we used magnetic field extrapolation of SDO/HMI magnetograms. The propagation velocity of wave fronts was measured from their spatial locations at specific times. In correlation curves of the 17 GHz (NoRH) radio emission we found a monotonous energy amplification of 3-min waves in the sunspot umbra before the 2012 June 7 flare. This dynamics agrees with an increase in the wave-train length in coronal loops (SDO/AIA, 171 {\AA}) reaching the maximum 30 minutes prior to the flare onset. A peculiarity of this flare time profile in soft X-rays (RHESSI, 3-25 keV) is maintaining the constant level of the flare emission for 10 minutes after the short impulse phase, which indicates at the energy release continuation. Throughout this time, we found 30-sec period transverse oscillations of the flare loop in the radio-frequency range (NoRH, 17 GHz). This periodicity is apparently related to the transformation of propagating longitudinal 3-min waves from the sunspot into the loop transverse oscillations. The magnetic field extrapolation showed the existence of the magnetic waveguide (loop) connecting the sunspot with the energy release region. A flare loop heating can be caused by the interaction (reconnections) of this transversally oscillating waveguide with the underlying twisted loops.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic fields in accretion disks play a dominant role during the star formation process but have hitherto been observationally poorly constrained. Field strengths have been inferred on T Tauri stars themselves and possibly in the innermost part of the accretion disk, but the strength and morphology of the field in the bulk of the disk have not been observed. Unresolved measurements of polarized emission (arising from elongated dust grains aligned perpendicular to the field) imply average fields aligned with the disks. Theoretically, the fields are expected to be largely toroidal, poloidal, or a mixture of the two, which imply different mechanisms for transporting angular momentum in the disks of actively accreting young stars such as HL Tau. Here we report resolved measurements of the polarized 1.25 mm continuum emission from HL Tau's disk. The magnetic field on a scale of 80 AU is coincident with the major axis (~210 AU diameter) of the disk. From this we conclude that the magnetic field inside the disk at this scale cannot be dominated by a vertical component, though a purely toroidal field does not fit the data well either. The unexpected morphology suggests that the magnetic field's role for the accretion of a T Tauri star is more complex than the current theoretical understanding.},

	Abstract = {The X-ray line at 6.4 keV has been observed from solar flares. It is found that Kalpha-fluorescence of neutral iron in the photosphere due to "thermal" (T ˜ 107 K) X-rays of the gradual phase is its dominant production mechanism. For a given flux and energy spectrum of incident X-rays, the flux at 1 AU of iron Kalpha-photons depends on the photospheric iron abundance, the height of the X-ray source, and the helio-centric angle between the flare and the observer. Therefore, the flux of iron Kalpha-photons, when measured simultaneously with the flux and energy spectrum of the X-ray continuum and the flare location, can give us information on the height of the X-ray source and the photospheric iron abundance. Here we present our Monte Carlo calculations of iron Kalpha -fluorescence efficiencies, so that they might be useful for interpretations of future measurements of the 6.4 keV line (e.g., by a detector to be flown on the Solar Maximum Mission).},

	Abstract = {The spatial morphology and dynamical status of a young, still-forming stellar cluster provide valuable clues on the conditions during the star formation event and the processes that regulated it. We analyze the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), utilizing the latest censuses of its stellar content and membership estimates over a large wavelength range. We determine the center of mass of the ONC, and study the radial dependence of angular substructure. The core appears rounder and smoother than the outskirts, consistent with a higher degree of dynamical processing. At larger distances the departure from circular symmetry is mostly driven by the elongation of the system, with very little additional substructure, indicating a somewhat evolved spatial morphology or an expanding halo. We determine the mass density profile of the cluster, which is well fitted by a power law that is slightly steeper than a singular isothermal sphere. Together with the ISM density, estimated from average stellar extinction, the mass content of the ONC is insufficient by a factor $\sim 1.8$ to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion from virialized motions, in agreement with previous assessments that the ONC is moderately supervirial. This may indicate recent gas dispersal. Based on the latest estimates for the age spread in the system and our density profiles, we find that, at the half-mass radius, 90% of the stellar population formed within $\sim 5$-$8$ free-fall times ($t_{\rm ff}$). This implies a star formation efficiency per $t_{\rm ff}$ of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim 0.04$-$0.07$, i.e., relatively slow and inefficient star formation rates during star cluster formation.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of FLAMES/UVES and FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectroscopic observations of 23 low-mass stars in the L1615/L1616 cometary cloud, complemented with FORS2 and VIMOS spectroscopy of 31 additional stars in the same cloud. L1615/L1616 is a cometary cloud where the star formation was triggered by the impact of the massive stars in the Orion OB association. From the measurements of the lithium abundance and radial velocity, we confirm the membership of our sample to the cloud. We use the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and the HeI $\lambda$5876, $\lambda$6678, $\lambda$7065 \AA$ $emission lines to calculate the accretion luminosities, $L_{\rm acc}$, and the mass accretion rates, $\dot M_{\rm acc}$. We find in L1615/L1616 a fraction of accreting objects ($\sim 30\%$), which is consistent with the typical fraction of accretors in T associations of similar age ($\sim 3$ Myr). The mass accretion rate for these stars shows a trend with the mass of the central object similar to that found for other star-forming regions, with a spread at a given mass which depends on the evolutionary model used to derive the stellar mass. Moreover, the behavior of the $2MASS/WISE$ colors with $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ indicates that strong accretors with $\log \dot M_{\rm acc} \gt -8.5$ dex show large excesses in the $JHK{\rm s}$ bands, as in previous studies. We also conclude that the accretion properties of the L1615/L1616 members are similar to those of young stellar objects in T associations, like Lupus.},

	Abstract = {We present Spitzer 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 micron images of the Mon OB1 East giant molecular cloud, which contains the young star forming region NGC 2264, as well as more extended star formation. With Spitzer data and 2MASS photometry, we identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs) with dusty circumstellar disks and/or envelopes in Mon OB1 East by their infrared-excess emission and study their distribution with respect to cloud material. We find a correlation between the local surface density of YSOs and column density of molecular gas as traced by dust extinction that is roughly described as a power law in these quantities. NGC 2264 follows a power law index of ~2.7, exhibiting a large YSO surface density for a given gas column density. Outside of NGC 2264 where the surface density of YSOs is lower, the power law is shallower and the region exhibits a larger gas column density for a YSO surface density, suggesting the star formation is more recent. In order to measure the fraction of cloud members with circumstellar disks/envelopes, we estimate the number of diskless pre-main sequence stars by statistical removal of background star detections. We find that the disk fraction of the NGC 2264 region is 45%, while the surrounding more distributed regions show a disk fraction of 19%. This may be explained by the presence an older, more dispersed population of stars. In total, the Spitzer observations provide evidence for heterogenous, non-coeval star formation throughout the Mon OB1 cloud.},

	Abstract = {Cygnus OB2 is the most massive association within 2kpc from the Sun, hosting hundreds of massive stars, thousands of young low mass members, and some sights of active star formation in the surrounding cloud. Recently, 10 photoevaporating proplyd-like objects with tadpole-shaped morphology were discovered in the outskirts of the OB association, approximately 6-14pc away from its center. The classification of these objects is ambiguous, being either evaporating residuals of the parental cloud which are hosting a protostar inside, or disk-bearing stars with an evaporating disk, such as the evaporating proplyds observed in the Trapezium Cluster in Orion. In this paper we present a study based on low resolution optical spectroscopic observations made with the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS), mounted on the 10.4m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), of two of these protostars. The spectrum of one of the objects shows evidence of accretion but not of outflows. In the latter object, the spectra show several emission lines indicating the presence of an actively accreting disk with outflow. We present estimates of the mass loss rate and the accretion rate from the disk, showing that the former exceeds the latter as observed in other known objects with evaporating disks. We also show evidence of a strong variability in the integrated flux observed in these objects, as well as in the accretion and outflow diagnostics.},

@article{moh13a,
	Abstract = {We present SCUBA-2 850 mum observations of seven very low mass stars (VLMS) and brown dwarfs (BDs). Three are in Taurus and four in the TW Hydrae Association (TWA), and all are classical T Tauri (cTT) analogs. We detect two of the three Taurus disks (one only marginally), but none of the TWA ones. For standard grains in cTT disks, our 3sigma limits correspond to a dust mass of 1.2 M ⊕ in Taurus and a mere 0.2 M ⊕ in the TWA (3-10× deeper than previous work). We combine our data with other submillimeter/millimeter (sub-mm/mm) surveys of Taurus, rho Oph, and the TWA to investigate the trends in disk mass and grain growth during the cTT phase. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100:1 and fiducial surface density and temperature profiles guided by current data, we find the following. (1) The minimum disk outer radius required to explain the upper envelope of sub-mm/mm fluxes is ~100 AU for intermediate-mass stars, solar types, and VLMS, and ~20 AU for BDs. (2) While the upper envelope of apparent disk masses increases with M * from BDs to VLMS to solar-type stars, no such increase is observed from solar-type to intermediate-mass stars. We propose this is due to enhanced photoevaporation around intermediate stellar masses. (3) Many of the disks around Taurus and rho Oph intermediate-mass and solar-type stars evince an opacity index of beta ~ 0-1, indicating significant grain growth. Of the only four VLMS/BDs in these regions with multi-wavelength measurements, three are consistent with considerable grain growth, though optically thick disks are not ruled out. (4) For the TWA VLMS (TWA 30A and B), combining our 850 mum fluxes with the known accretion rates and ages suggests substantial grain growth by 10 Myr, comparable to that in the previously studied TWA cTTs Hen 3-600A and TW Hya. The degree of grain growth in the TWA BDs (2M1207A and SSPM1102) remains largely unknown. (5) A Bayesian analysis shows that the apparent disk-to-stellar mass ratio has a roughly constant mean of log10[M disk/M *] ≈ -2.4 all the way from intermediate-mass stars to VLMS/BDs, supporting previous qualitative suggestions that the ratio is ~1% throughout the stellar/BD domain. (6) Similar analysis shows that the disk mass in close solar-type Taurus binaries (sep <100 AU) is significantly lower than in singles (by a factor of 10), while that in wide solar-type Taurus binaries (>=100 AU) is closer to that in singles (lower by a factor of three). (7) We discuss the implications of these results for planet formation around VLMS/BDs, and for the observed dependence of accretion rate on stellar mass.},

@article{rig13a,
	Abstract = {The formation time, masses, and location of planets are strongly impacted by the physical mechanisms that disperse protoplanetary disks and the timescale over which protoplanetary material is cleared out. Accretion of matter onto the central star, protostellar winds/jets, magnetic disk winds, and photoevaporative winds operate concurrently. Hence, disentangling their relative contribution to disk dispersal requires identifying diagnostics that trace different star-disk environments. Here, we analyze the low-velocity component (LVC) of the oxygen optical forbidden lines, which is found to be blueshifted by a few km s-1 with respect to the stellar velocity. We find that the [O I] LVC profiles are different from those of [Ne II] at 12.81 mum and CO at 4.7 mum lines pointing to different origins for these gas lines. We report a correlation between the luminosity of the [O I] LVC and the accretion luminosity L acc. We do not find any correlation with the X-ray luminosity, while we find that the higher is the stellar far-UV (FUV) luminosity, the higher is the luminosity of the [O I] LVC. In addition, we show that the [O I] lambda6300/lambda5577 ratio is low (ranging between 1 and 8). These findings favor an origin of the [O I] LVC in a region where OH is photodissociated by stellar FUV photons and argue against thermal emission from an X-ray-heated layer. Detailed modeling of two spectra with the highest S/N and resolution shows that there are two components within the LVC: a broad, centrally peaked component that can be attributed to gas arising in a warm disk surface in Keplerian rotation (with FWHM between ~40 and ~60 km s-1), and a narrow component (with FWHM ~ 10 km s-1 and small blueshifts of ~2 km s-1) that may arise in a cool (lsim1000 K) molecular wind.},

	Abstract = {The amount of high-energy stellar radiation reaching the surface of protoplanetary disks is essential to determine their chemistry and physical evolution. Here, we use millimetric and centimetric radio data to constrain the EUV luminosity impinging on 14 disks around young (~2-10Myr) sun-like stars. For each object we identify the long-wavelength emission in excess to the dust thermal emission, attribute that to free-free disk emission, and thereby compute an upper limit to the EUV reaching the disk. We find upper limits lower than 10$^{42}$ photons/s for all sources without jets and lower than $5 \times 10^{40}$ photons/s for the three older sources in our sample. These latter values are low for EUV-driven photoevaporation alone to clear out protoplanetary material in the timescale inferred by observations. In addition, our EUV upper limits are too low to reproduce the [NeII] 12.81 micron luminosities from three disks with slow [NeII]-detected winds. This indicates that the [NeII] line in these sources primarily traces a mostly neutral wind where Ne is ionized by 1 keV X-ray photons, implying higher photoevaporative mass loss rates than those predicted by EUV-driven models alone. In summary, our results suggest that high-energy stellar photons other than EUV may dominate the dispersal of protoplanetary disks around sun-like stars.},

	Abstract = {The YSOVAR (Young Stellar Object VARiability) Spitzer Space Telescope observing program obtained the first extensive mid-infrared (3.6 & 4.5 um) time-series photometry of the Orion Nebula Cluster plus smaller footprints in eleven other star-forming cores (AFGL490, NGC1333, MonR2, GGD 12-15, NGC2264, L1688, Serpens Main, Serpens South, IRAS 20050+2720, IC1396A, and Ceph C). There are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both IRAC channels in the YSOVAR data set. We present the data collection and reduction for the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the "standard sample" on which we calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs about twice per day for ~40d. We also define a "standard sample of members", consisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. We characterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the fast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, and significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales possible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer mission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each cluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the ratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a higher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term variables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color, we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter periods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability that causes [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of members and field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted the first comprehensive mm-wave molecular emission line surveys of the evolved circumstellar disks orbiting the nearby T Tauri stars TW Hya and V4046 Sgr AB. Both disks are known to retain significant residual gaseous components, despite the advanced ages of their host stars. Our unbiased broad-band radio spectral surveys of the TW Hya and V4046 Sgr disks were performed with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12 meter telescope and are intended to yield a complete census of bright molecular emission lines in the range 275-357 GHz (1.1-0.85 mm). We find that lines of 12CO, 13CO, HCN, CN, and C2H, all of which lie in the higher-frequency range, constitute the strongest molecular emission from both disks in the spectral region surveyed. The molecule C2H is detected here for the first time in both disks, as is CS in the TW Hya disk. The survey results also include the first measurements of the full suite of hyperfine transitions of CN N=3-2 and C2H N=4-3 in both disks. Modeling of these CN and C2H hyperfine complexes in the spectrum of TW Hya indicates that the emission from both species is optically thick and may originate from very cold disk regions. It furthermore appears that the fractional abundances of CN and C2H are significantly enhanced in these evolved protoplanetary disks relative to the fractional abundances of the same molecules in the environments of deeply embedded protostars.},

	Abstract = {Stars mostly form in groups consisting of a few dozen to several ten thousand members. For 30 years, theoretical models provide a basic concept of how such star clusters form and develop: they originate from the gas and dust of collapsing molecular clouds. The conversion from gas to stars being incomplete, the left over gas is expelled, leading to cluster expansion and stars becoming unbound. Observationally, a direct confirmation of this process has proved elusive, which is attributed to the diversity of the properties of forming clusters. Here we take into account that the true cluster masses and sizes are masked, initially by the surface density of the background and later by the still present unbound stars. Based on the recent observational finding that in a given star-forming region the star formation efficiency depends on the local density of the gas, we use an analytical approach combined with \mbox{N-body simulations, to reveal} evolutionary tracks for young massive clusters covering the first 10 Myr. Just like the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a measure for the evolution of stars, these tracks provide equivalent information for clusters. Like stars, massive clusters form and develop faster than their lower-mass counterparts, explaining why so few massive cluster progenitors are found.},

	Abstract = {The 9 Myr old TW Hya Association (TWA) is the nearest group (typical distances of $\sim$50 pc) of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars with ages less than 10 Myr and contains stars with both actively accreting disks and debris disks. We have studied the coronal X-ray emission from a group of low mass TWA common proper motion binaries using the {\it{Chandra}} and {\it{Swift}} satellites. Our aim is to understand better their coronal properties and how high energy photons affect the conditions around young stars and their role in photo-exciting atoms, molecules and dust grains in circumstellar disks and lower density circumstellar gas. Once planet formation is underway, this emission influences protoplanetary evolution and the atmospheric conditions of the newly-formed planets. The X-ray properties for 7 individual stars (TWA 13A, TWA 13B, TWA 9A, TWA 9B, TWA 8A, TWA 8B, and TWA 7) and 2 combined binary systems (TWA 3AB and TWA 2AB) have been measured. All the stars with sufficient signal require two-component fits to their CCD-resolution X-ray spectra, typically with a dominant hot (~2 kev (25 MK)) component and a cooler component at ~0.4 keV (4 MK). The brighter sources all show significant X-ray variability (at a level of 50-100\% of quiescence) over the course of 5-15 ksec observations due to flares. We present the X-ray properties for each of the stars and find that the coronal emission is in the super-saturated rotational domain.},

	Abstract = {The chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive to their ionization environment. Sources of molecular gas ionization include cosmic rays, stellar X-rays and short-lived radionuclides, each of which varies with location in the disk. This behavior leads to a significant amount of chemical structure, especially in molecular ion abundances, which is imprinted in their submillimeter rotational line emission. Using an observationally motivated disk model, we make predictions for the dependence of chemical abundances on the assumed properties of the ionizing field. We calculate the emergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitive observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) for a disk at D=100 pc. The models readily distinguish between high ionization rates ($\zeta\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ per H$_2$) and below, but it becomes difficult to distinguish between low ionization models when $\zeta\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. We find that \htdp\ emission is not detectable for sub-interstellar CR rates with ALMA (6h integration), and that \ntdp\ emission may be a more sensitive tracer of midplane ionization. HCO$^+$ traces X-rays and high CR rates ($\zeta_{\rm{CR}}\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$), and provides a handle on the warm molecular ionization properties where CO is present in the gas. Furthermore, species like HCO$^+$, which emits from a wide radial region and samples a large gradient in temperature, can exhibit ring-like emission as a consequence of low-lying rotational level de-excitation near the star. This finding highlights a scenario where rings are not necessarily structural or chemical in nature, but simply a result of the underlying line excitation properties.},

	Abstract = {Using the IRAM 30m telescope we have surveyed a $1\times0.8^{\circ}$ part of the Orion molecular cloud in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (2-1) lines with a maximal spatial resolution of $\sim$11" and spectral resolution of $\sim$ 0.4 km~s$^{-1}$. The cloud appears filamentary, clumpy and with a complex kinematical structure. We derive an estimated mass of the cloud of 7700 M$_{\text{Sun}}$ (half of which is found in regions with visual extinctions $A_V$ below $\sim$10) and a dynamical age for the nebula of the order of 0.2 Myrs. The energy balance suggests that magnetic fields play an important role in supporting the cloud, at large and small scales. According to our analysis, the turbulent kinetic energy in the molecular gas due to outflows is comparable to turbulent kinetic energy resulting from the interaction of the cloud with the HII region. This latter feedback appears negative, i.e. the triggering of star formation by the HII region is inefficient in Orion. The reduced data as well as additional products such as the column density map are made available online at http://userpages.irap.omp.eu/~oberne/Olivier_Berne/Data.},

Neither the width, nor the line profile is understood. Likely, different mechanisms influence the line profile; the best candidates are accretion, winds and stellar activity. We monitored the C IV 1548/1550 Ang doublet in the nearby, bright CTTS TW Hya with the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (HST/COS) to correlate it with i) the cool wind, as seen in COS NUV Mg II line profiles, ii) the photometric period from joint ground-based monitoring, iii) the accretion rate as determined from the UV continuum, and iv) the Ha line profile from independent ground-based observations. The observations span 10 orbits distributed over a few weeks to cover the typical time scales of stellar rotation, accretion and winds. Here we describe a model with intrinsically asymmetric C IV lines.},

	Abstract = {The emission from young stellar objects (YSOs) in the mid-IR is dominated by the inner rim of their circumstellar disks. We present an IR-monitoring survey of about 800 objects in the direction of the Lynds 1688 (L1688) star forming region over four visibility windows spanning 1.6 years using the \emph{Spitzer} space telescope in its warm mission phase. Among all lightcurves, 57 sources are cluster members identified based on their spectral-energy distribution and X-ray emission. Almost all cluster members show significant variability. The amplitude of the variability is larger in more embedded YSOs. Ten out of 57 cluster members have periodic variations in the lightcurves with periods typically between three and seven days, but even for those sources, significant variability in addition to the periodic signal can be seen. No period is stable over 1.6 years. Non-periodic lightcurves often still show a preferred timescale of variability which is longer for more embedded sources. About half of all sources exhibit redder colors in a fainter state. This is compatible with time-variable absorption towards the YSO. The other half becomes bluer when fainter. These colors can only be explained with significant changes in the structure of the inner disk. No relation between mid-IR variability and stellar effective temperature or X-ray spectrum is found.},

	Abstract = {Observations of late-type main-sequence stars have revealed an empirical scaling of coronal activity versus Rossby number Ro (a ratio of rotation period to convective turnover time) which has hitherto lacked a theoretical explanation. For Ro >> 1, the activity measured as X-ray to bolometric flux varies as Ro^{-q} with q between 2 and 3, whilst q=0 for Ro << 1. Here we provide physical arguments to explain the transition between these two regimes and the power law in the Ro >> 1 regime. We do so by constructing an expression for the coronal luminosity based on dynamo magnetic field generation and magnetic buoyancy. We explain the Ro<<1 behavior from the inference that observed rotation is a proxy for differential rotation and argue that once the shear time scale is shorter than the convective turnover time, eddies will be shredded on the shear time scale and so the eddy correlation time actually becomes the shear time and the convection time drops out of the equations, explaining the q~0 regime. We explain the finite q of the Ro >> 1 regime using a dynamo saturation theory based on magnetic helicity buildup and buoyant loss.},

	Abstract = {In light of recent substantial updates to spectral type estimations and newly established intrinsic colours, effective temperatures, and bolometric corrections for pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, we re-address the theory of accretion-disc regulated stellar angular momentum (AM) evolution. We report on the compilation of a consistent sample of fully convective stars within two of the most well-studied and youngest, nearby regions of star formation: the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and Taurus-Auriga. We calculate the average specific stellar AM ($j_{\star}$) assuming solid body rotation, using surface rotation periods gathered from the literature and new estimates of stellar radii and ages. We use published Spitzer IRAC fluxes to classify our stars as Class II or Class III and compare their $j_{\star}$ evolution. Our results suggest that disc dispersal is a rapid process that occurs at a variety of ages. We find a consistent $j_{\star}$ reduction rate between the Class II and Class III PMS stars which we interpret as indicating a period of accretion disc-regulated AM evolution followed by near-constant AM evolution once the disc has dissipated. Furthermore, assuming our observed spread in stellar ages is real, we find the removal rate of $j_{\star}$ during the Class II phase is more rapid than expected by contraction at constant stellar rotation rate. A much more efficient process of AM removal must exist, most likely in the form of an accretion-driven stellar wind or other outflow from the star-disc interaction region or extended disc surface.},

	Abstract = {With Herschel/PACS 134 low mass members of the Taurus star-forming region spanning the M4-L0 spectral type range and covering the transition from low mass stars to brown dwarfs were observed. Combining the new Herschel results with other programs, a total of 150 of the 154 M4-L0 Taurus members members have observations with Herschel. Among the 150 targets, 70um flux densities were measured for 7 of the 7 ClassI objects, 48 of the 67 ClassII members, and 3 of the 76 ClassIII targets. For the detected ClassII objects, the median 70um flux density level declines with spectral type, however, the distribution of excess relative to central object flux density does not change across the stellar/substellar boundary in the M4-L0 range. Connecting the 70um TBOSS values with the results from K0-M3 ClassII members results in the first comprehensive census of far-IR emission across the full mass spectrum of the stellar and substellar population of a star-forming region, and the median flux density declines with spectral type in a trend analogous to the flux density decline expected for the central objects. SEDs were constructed for all TBOSS targets covering the optical to far-IR range and extending to the submm/mm for a subset of sources. Based on an initial exploration of the impact of different physical parameters; inclination, scale height and flaring have the largest influence on the PACS flux densities. From the 24um to 70um spectral index of the SEDs, 5 new candidate transition disks were identified. The steep 24um to 70um slope for a subset of 8 TBOSS targets may be an indication of truncated disks in these systems.Two examples of mixed pair systems that include secondaries with disks were measured. Finally, comparing the TBOSS results with a Herschel study of Ophiuchus brown dwarfs reveals a lower fraction of disks around the Taurus substellar population.},

	Abstract = {Sharp chemical discontinuities can occur in protoplanetary discs, particularly at `snow-lines' where a gas-phase species freezes out to form ice grains. Such sharp discontinuities will diffuse out due to the turbulence suspected to drive angular momentum transport in accretion discs. We demonstrate that the concentration gradient - in the vicinity of the snow-line - of a species present outside a snow-line but destroyed inside is strongly sensitive to the level of turbulent diffusion (provided the chemical and transport time-scales are decoupled) and provides a direct measurement of the radial `Schmidt number' (the ratio of the angular momentum transport to radial turbulent diffusion). Taking as an example the tracer species N$_2$H$^+$, which is expected to be destroyed inside the CO snow-line (as recently observed in TW Hya) we show that ALMA observations possess significant angular resolution to constrain the Schmidt number. Since different turbulent driving mechanisms predict different Schmidt numbers, a direct measurement of the Schmidt number in accretion discs would allow inferences about the nature of the turbulence to be made.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescent X-ray emission offers a rare possibility for studying cool material surrounding active, young stars in the X-ray regime. In this work, we develop a new method to search for fluorescent emission and analyze its temporal behavior, which we apply to a sample of 106 young, active stars in Orion. Our analysis yields a sample of 23 X-ray sources with fluorescent emission, including 6 objects already reported on in an earlier study. The fluorescent sources show a wide variety of temporal behavior. While the fluorescent emission is associated with soft X-ray flares in some cases, it sometimes appears as a (quasi) persistent feature, or is seen during truly quiescent periods. We conclude that fluorescent X-ray emission can be observed in a much higher fraction of young, active stars than previously believed. Whether photoionization alone is the excitation mechanism of fluorescent X-ray emission or if electronic collisional excitation also contributes remains debatable. The temporal variability is often hard to reconcile with the photoionization model, which remains plausible if we allow for suitable geometries. Photoionization is preferred to electronic, collisional excitation mainly because the energetics of the latter challenge our current physical understanding.},

	Abstract = {Context. The lack of knowledge of photospheric parameters and the level of chromospheric activity in young low-mass pre-main sequence stars introduces uncertainties when measuring mass accretion rates in accreting (Class II) young stellar objects. A detailed investigation of the effect of chromospheric emission on the estimates of mass accretion rate in young low-mass stars is still missing. This can be undertaken using samples of young diskless (Class III) K and M-type stars.  Aims: Our goal is to measure the chromospheric activity of Class III pre main sequence stars to determine its effect on the estimates of the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) in young stellar objects with disks.  Methods: Using VLT/X-shooter spectra, we analyzed a sample of 24 nonaccreting young stellar objects of spectral type between K5 and M9.5. We identified the main emission lines normally used as tracers of accretion in Class II objects, and we determined their fluxes in order to estimate the contribution of the chromospheric activity to the line luminosity.  Results: We have used the relationships between line luminosity and accretion luminosity derived in the literature for Class II objects to evaluate the impact of chromospheric activity on the accretion rate measurements. We find that the typical chromospheric activity would bias the derived accretion luminosity by Lacc,noise< 10-3 L&sun;, with a strong dependence on the Teff of the objects. The noise on Macc depends on stellar mass and age, and the typical values of log(Macc,noise) range between ~-9.2 to -11.6 M&sun;/yr.  Conclusions: Values of Lacc ≲10-3 L&sun; obtained in accreting low-mass pre main sequence stars through line luminosity should be treated with caution because the line emission may be dominated by the contribution of chromospheric activity.

@article{man13a,
	Abstract = {Context. Current planet formation models are largely based on the observational constraint that protoplanetary disks have a lifetime of ~3 Myr. Recent studies, however, report the existence of pre-main-sequence stars with signatures of accretion (strictly connected with the presence of circumstellar disks) and photometrically determined ages of 30 Myr or more.  Aims: Here, we present a spectroscopic study of two major age outliers in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We use broadband, intermediate resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra combined with an accurate method to determine the stellar parameters and the related age of the targets to confirm their peculiar age estimates and the presence of ongoing accretion.  Methods: The analysis is based on a multicomponent fitting technique, which derives simultaneously spectral type, extinction, and accretion properties of the objects. With this method, we confirm and quantify the ongoing accretion. From the photospheric parameters of the stars, we derive their position on the H-R diagram and the age given by evolutionary models. With other age indicators like the lithium-equivalent width, we estimate the age of the objects with high accuracy.  Results: Our study shows that the two objects analyzed are not older than the typical population of the Orion Nebula Cluster. While photometric determination of the photospheric parameters are an accurate method to estimate the parameters of the bulk of young stellar populations, our results show that those of individual objects with high accretion rates and extinction may be affected by large uncertainties. Broadband spectroscopic determinations should thus be used to confirm the nature of individual objects.  Conclusions: The analysis carried out shows that this method allows us to obtain an accurate determination of the photospheric parameters of accreting young stellar objects in any nearby star-forming region. We suggest that our detailed, broadband spectroscopy method should be used to derive accurate properties of candidate old and accreting young stellar objects in star-forming regions. We also discuss how a similarly accurate determination of stellar properties can be obtained through a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data.  This work is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (Pr.Id. 288.C-5038, 089.C-0840, 090.C-0050).},

	Abstract = {We present a search for stellar activity (flares and mass ejections) in a sample of 28 stars in the young open cluster Blanco-1. We use optical spectra obtained with ESO's VIMOS multi-object spectrograph installed on the VLT. From the total observing time of $\sim$ 5 hours, we find four H$\alpha$ flares but no distinct indication of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the investigated dK-dM stars. Two flares show "dips" in their light-curves right before their impulsive phases which are similar to previous discoveries in photometric light-curves of active dMe stars. We estimate an upper limit of $<$4 CMEs per day per star and discuss this result with respect to a semi- empirical estimation of the CME rate of main-sequence stars. We find that we should have detected at least one CME per star with a mass of 1-15$\times10^{16}$ g depending on the star's X-ray luminosity, but the estimated H$\alpha$ fluxes associated with these masses are below the detection limit of our observations. We conclude that the parameter which mainly influences the detection of stellar CMEs using the method of Doppler-shifted emission caused by moving plasma is not the spectral resolution or velocity but the flux or mass of the CME.},

	Abstract = {By utilizing high resolution observations of nearly co-temporal and co-spatial SOT spectropolarimeter and XRT coronal X-ray data onboard Hinode, we revisit the contentious issue of the relationship between global magnetic quantities and coronal X-ray intensity. Co-aligned vector magnetogram and X-ray data are used for this study. We find that there is no pixel-to-pixel correlation between the observed loop brightness and magnetic quantities. However, the X-ray brightness is well correlated with the integrated magnetic quantities such as total unsigned magnetic flux, total unsigned vertical current, area integrated square of the vertical magnetic field and horizontal magnetic fields. Comparing all these quantities we find that the total magnetic flux correlates well with the observed integrated X-ray brightness, though there is some differences in the strength of the correlation when we use the X-ray data from different filters. While we get a good correlation between X-ray brightness and total unsigned vertical current when we use the X-ray data sets obtained from the Al-poly filter, we find no correlation between them using data sets obtained from the Ti-poly filter. We confirm that there is no consistent correlation between measures of non-potentiality and coronal X-ray intensity in these high resolution observations; thus earlier results using low resolution observations in this context are validated. We discuss the implications of these observational results for the heating of the solar corona.},

	Abstract = {Transitional disks (TDs) are thought to be a late evolutionary stage of protoplanetary disks with dust depleted inner regions. The mechanism responsible for this depletion is still under debate. To constrain the models it is mandatory to have a good understanding of the properties of the gas content of the inner disk. Using X-Shooter broad band -UV to NIR- medium resolution spectroscopy we derive the stellar, accretion, and wind properties of a sample of 22 TDs. The analysis of these properties allows us to put strong constraints on the gas content in a region very close to the star (<0.2 AU) which is not accessible with any other observational technique. We fit the spectra with a self-consistent procedure to derive simultaneously SpT,Av,and mass accretion rates (Macc) of the targets. From forbidden emission lines we derive the wind properties of the targets. Comparing our findings to values for cTTs, we find that Macc and wind properties of 80% of the TDs in our sample, which is strongly biased towards strongly accreting objects, are comparable to those of cTTs. Thus, there are (at least) some TDs with Macc compatible with those of cTTs, irrespective of the size of the dust inner hole.Only in 2 cases Macc are much lower, while the wind properties are similar. We do not see any strong trend of Macc with the size of the dust depleted cavity, nor with the presence of a dusty optically thick disk close to the star. In the TDs in our sample there is a gas rich inner disk with density similar to that of cTTs disks. At least for some TDs, the process responsible of the inner disk clearing should allow for a transfer of gas from the outer disk to the inner region. This should proceed at a rate that does not depend on the physical mechanism producing the gap seen in the dust emission and results in a gas density in the inner disk similar to that of unperturbed disks around stars of similar mass.},

	Abstract = {Investigating the evolution of protoplanetary disks is crucial for our understanding of star and planet formation. Several theoretical and observational studies have been performed in the last decades to advance this knowledge. FT Tauri is a young star in the Taurus star forming region that was included in a number of spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We investigate the properties of the star, the circumstellar disk, and the accretion and ejection processes and propose a consistent gas and dust model also as a reference for future observational studies. We performed a multi-wavelength data analysis to derive the basic stellar and disk properties, as well as mass accretion/outflow rate from TNG-Dolores, WHT-Liris, NOT-Notcam, Keck-Nirspec, and Herschel-Pacs spectra. From the literature, we compiled a complete Spectral Energy Distribution. We then performed detailed disk modeling using the MCFOST and ProDiMo codes. Multi-wavelengths spectroscopic and photometric measurements were compared with the reddened predictions of the codes in order to constrain the disk properties. This object can serve as a benchmark for primordial disks with significant mass accretion rate, high gas content and typical size.},

	Abstract = {We analyze a 96 ks Chandra HETGS observation of the single G-type giant HR 9024. The high flux allows us to examine spectral line and continuum diagnostics at high temporal resolution, to derive plasma parameters. A time-dependent one-dimensional hydrodynamic model of a loop with half-length L=5×1011 cm (~R*/2) and cross-sectional radius r=4.3×1010 cm, with a heat pulse of 15 ks and 2×1011 ergs cm-2 s-1 deposited at the loop footpoints, satisfactorily reproduces the observed evolution of temperature and emission measure, derived from the analysis of the strong continuum emission. For the first time we can compare predictions from the hydrodynamic model with single spectral features, other than with global spectral properties. We find that the model closely matches the observed line emission, especially for the hot (~108 K) plasma emission of the Fe XXV complex at ~1.85 {\AA}. The model loop has L/R*~1/2 and aspect ratio r/L~0.1, as typically derived for flares observed in active stellar coronae, suggesting that the underlying physics is the same for these very dynamic and extreme phenomena in stellar coronae independently of stellar parameters and evolutionary stage.},

	Abstract = {Atomic-level polarization and Zeeman effect diagnostics in the neutral helium triplet at 10830 {\AA} in principle allow full vector magnetometry of fine-scaled chromospheric fibrils. We present high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of superpenumbral fibrils in the He I triplet with sufficient polarimetric sensitivity to infer their full magnetic field geometry. He I observations from the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter are paired with high-resolution observations of the Halpha 6563 {\AA} and Ca II 8542 {\AA} spectral lines from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer from the Dunn Solar Telescope in New Mexico. Linear and circular polarization signatures in the He I triplet are measured and described, as well as analyzed with the advanced inversion capability of the "Hanle and Zeeman Light" modeling code. Our analysis provides direct evidence for the often assumed field alignment of fibril structures. The projected angle of the fibrils and the inferred magnetic field geometry align within an error of $\pm$10$\,^{\circ}$. We describe changes in the inclination angle of these features that reflect their connectivity with the photospheric magnetic field. Evidence for an accelerated flow (~40 m s-2) along an individual fibril anchored at its endpoints in the strong sunspot and weaker plage in part supports the magnetic siphon flow mechanism's role in the inverse Evershed effect. However, the connectivity of the outer endpoint of many of the fibrils cannot be established.},

	Abstract = {The C II] feature at ~2325 Angstrom is very prominent in the spectra of T Tauri stars (TTSs). This feature is a quintuplet of semiforbidden transitions excited at electron temperatures around 10,000 K that, together with the nearby Si II] and Fe II] features, provides a reliable optically thin tracer for accurate measurement of the plasma properties in the magnetospheres of TTSs. The spectra of 20 (out of 27) TTSs observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have good enough signal to noise ratio (S/N) at the C II] wavelength. For these stars we have determined electron densities (ne) and temperatures (Te) in the line emission region as well as the profile broadening (sigma). For most of the stars in the sample (17) we obtain 10^{4.1} < Te < 10^{4.5} K and 10^{8} < ne < 10^{12} cm^{-3}. These stars have suprathermal line broadening (35 < sigma < 165 km s^{-1}), except TW Hya and CY Tau with thermal line broadening. Both C II] line luminosity and broadening are found to correlate with the accretion rate. Line emission seems to be produced in the magnetospheric accretion flow, close to the disk. There are three exceptions: DG Tau, RY Tau and FU Ori. The line centroids are blueshifted indicating that the line emission in these three stars is dominated by the outflow.},

	Abstract = {Context: The diagnostics of stellar flaring coronal loops have been so far largely based on the analysis of the decay phase.   Aims: We derive new diagnostics from the analysis of the rise and peak phase of stellar flares.  Methods: We release the assumption of full equilibrium of the flaring loop at the flare peak, according to the frequently observed delay between the temperature and the density maximum. From scaling laws and hydrodynamic simulations we derive diagnostic formulas as a function of observable quantities and times. Results: We obtain a diagnostic toolset related to the rise phase, including the loop length, density and aspect ratio. We discuss the limitations of this approach and find that the assumption of loop equilibrium in the analysis of the decay leads to a moderate overestimate of the loop length. A few relevant applications to previously analyzed stellar flares are shown. Conclusions: The analysis of the flare rise and peak phase complements and completes the analysis of the decay phase.},

	Abstract = {There are many pertinent open issues in the area of star and planet formation. Large statistical samples of young stars across star-forming regions are needed to trigger a breakthrough in our understanding, but most optical studies are based on a wide variety of spectrographs and analysis methods, which introduces large biases.  Here we show how graphical Bayesian networks can be employed to construct a hierarchical probabilistic model which allows pre-main-sequence ages, masses, accretion rates and extinctions to be estimated using two widely available photometric survey data bases (Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric Halpha Survey r'/Halpha/i' and Two Micron All Sky Survey J-band magnitudes). Because our approach does not rely on spectroscopy, it can easily be applied to ho-mogeneously study the large number of clusters for which Gaia will yield membership lists.  We explain how the analysis is carried out using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and provide PYTHON source code. We then demonstrate its use on 587 known low-mass members of the star-forming region NGC 2264 (Cone Nebula), arriving at a median age of 3.0 Myr, an accretion fraction of 20 $\pm$ 2 per cent and a median accretion rate of 10-8.4 M&sun; yr-1.  The Bayesian analysis formulated in this work delivers results which are in agreement with spectroscopic studies already in the literature, but achieves this with great efficiency by depending only on photometry. It is a significant step forward from previous photometric studies because the probabilistic approach ensures that nuisance parameters, such as extinction and distance, are fully included in the analysis with a clear picture on any degeneracies.},

@article{mar13a,
	Abstract = {We have obtained JHK near-IR images and JH band low-resolution spectra of candidate members of the southern region of the young open cluster NGC 2264. We have determined spectral types from H-band spectra for 54 sources, 25 of which are classified for the first time. The stars in our sample cover a large range of spectral types (A8-M8). Using a cluster distance of 780 pc, we determined a median age of 1 Myr for this region of NGC 2264, with 90% of the stars being 5 Myr or younger. To improve the statistical significance of our sample, we included 66 additional cluster members within our field of view with optical spectral classification in the literature. We derived infrared excesses using stellar properties to model the photospheric emission for each source and the extinction to correct FLAMINGOS near-IR and Spitzer mid-IR photometry, and obtained a disk fraction of 51% $\pm$ 5% for the region. Binning the stars by stellar mass, we find a disk fraction of 38% $\pm$ 9% for the 0.1-0.3 solar mass group, 55% $\pm$ 6% for 0.3-1 solar masses, and 58% $\pm$ 10% for the higher than 1 solar mass group. The lower disk fraction for the lower mass stars is similar to the results found in non-cluster regions like Taurus and Chamaeleon, but differs from the older 3 Myr cluster IC 348 in which the disk fraction is lower for the higher mass stars. This mass-dependent disk fraction is accentuated in the sample with isochrone ages younger than 2 Myr. Here, we find that 45% $\pm$ 11% of the 0.1-0.3 solar mass stars have disks, 60% $\pm$ 7% of the 0.3-1 solar mass stars have disks, and all 1-3 solar mass stars have disks. Stellar masses might be an important factor in the ability of a system to form or retain a disk early on. However, regardless of the stellar mass, the large infrared excesses expected from optically thick disks disappear within the first 2 Myr for all stars in our study and small excesses from optically thin disks are found mostly in sources younger than 4 Myr.  Based on observations obtained at the KPNO.},

	Abstract = {We present new deep ($\sigma\sim6~\mu$Jy) radio images of the HH~124~IRS Radio Cluster at 4.8 and 7.5 GHz. We detect a total of 50 radio sources, most of them compact. Variability and spectral indices were analyzed in order to determine the nature of the sources and of their radio emission. A proper motion study was also performed for several of these radio sources using radio observation previously reported. Our analysis shows that 11 radio sources can be related with Galactic objects, most of them probably young stars. Interestingly, eight of these sources are in an area less than 1 square arcminute in size. The importance of such compact clusters resides in that all its members can be observed in a single pointing with most telescopes, and are, therefore, ideal for multi-wavelength studies of variability. Another 4 of the detected sources are clearly extragalactic. Finally, we propose from statistical arguments that from the remaining sources, about 10 are Galactic, but our study does not allow us to identify which of the sources fall in that specific category. The relatively large proper motions observed for the sources in HH~124~IRS suggest that this region is located at about 400 pc from the Sun. This is significantly smaller than the $\sim$800--900 pc distance usually assigned to the nearby open cluster NGC~2264 with which HH~124 is thought to be associated. However, a reanalysis of the Hipparcos parallaxes for members of NGC~2264, a convergent point approach, and a kinematic analysis all argue in favor of a distance of order 400 pc for NGC~2264 as well.},

	Abstract = {Observations reveal a correspondence between chromospheric type II spicules and bright upwardly moving fronts in the corona observed in the EUV band. However, theoretical considerations suggest that these flows are unlikely to be the main source of heating in coronal magnetic loops. We investigate the propagation of high-speed chromospheric flows into coronal magnetic flux tubes, and the possible production of emission in the EUV band. We simulate the propagation of a dense $10^4$ K chromospheric jet upwards along a coronal loop, by means of a 2-D cylindrical MHD model, including gravity, radiative losses, thermal conduction and magnetic induction. The jet propagates in a complete atmosphere including the chromosphere and a tenuous cool ($\sim 0.8$ MK) corona, linked through a steep transition region. In our reference model, the jet's initial speed is 70 km/s, its initial density is $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, and the ambient uniform magnetic field is 10 G. We explore also other values of jet speed and density in 1-D, and of magnetic field in 2-D, and the jet propagation in a hotter ($\sim 1.5$ MK) background loop. While the initial speed of the jet does not allow it to reach the loop apex, a hot shock front develops ahead of it and travels to the other extreme of the loop. The shock front compresses the coronal plasma and heats it to about $10^6$ K. As a result, a bright moving front becomes visible in the 171 \AA\ channel of the SDO/AIA mission. This result generally applies to all the other explored cases, except for the propagation in the hotter loop. For a cool, low-density initial coronal loop, the post-shock plasma ahead of upward chromospheric flows might explain at least part of the observed correspondence between type II spicules and EUV emission excess.},

	Abstract = {Context. Solar flares radiate energy at all wavelengths, but the spectral distribution of this energy is still poorly known. White-light continuum emission is sometimes observed, and these flares are then called "white-light flares" (WLFs).  Aims: We investigate if all flares are WLFs and how the radiated energy is distributed spectrally.  Methods: We perform a superposed epoch analysis of spectral and total irradiance measurements obtained since 1996 by the SOHO and GOES spacecraft at various wavelengths, from soft X-rays to the visible domain.  Results: The long-term record of solar irradiance and the excellent duty cycle of the measurements allow us to detect a signal in visible irradiance even for moderate (C-class) flares mainly during the impulsive phase. We identify this signal as continuum emission emitted by WLFs and find that it is consistent with a blackbody emission at ~9000 K. We estimate the contribution of the WL continuum for several sets of flares and find it to be about 70% of the total radiated energy. We re-analyse the X17 flare that occurred on 28 October 2003 and find similar results.  Conclusions: We show that most of the flares - if not all - are WLFs and that the white-light continuum is the main contributor to the total radiated energy; this continuum is consistent with a blackbody spectrum at ~9000 K. These observational results are important for understanding the physical mechanisms during flares and possibly suggest a contribution of flares to the variations of the total solar irradiance (TSI).},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a search for white-light flares on ~23,000 cool dwarfs in the Kepler Quarter 1 long cadence data. We have identified 373 flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observation period. We calculate relative flare energies, flare rates, and durations and compare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. We find that M dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than K dwarfs and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosity in a given flare than K dwarfs. Stars that are more photometrically variable in quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability is only weakly correlated with flare frequency. We estimate distances for our sample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with other observations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the Galactic plane. These observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares by sampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and are informative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetary habitability.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous ultraviolet and optical observations of five flares on the very late type M dwarf Gl 866 (dM5.5e). A procedure to estimate the physical parameters of the flaring plasma has been developed using a simplified model of the flare and a comparison of observed and computed Balmer decrements. With this procedure we have determined the optical thickness, electron temperature and electron density of the flaring plasma at flare maximum for three spectroscopically observed flares. The three spectroscopically observed flares cover up to 5 percent of the stellar surface and have areas similar to solar flares.},

	Abstract = {In our multi-epoch observation of the star-forming region NGC 2264 with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry, we detected two water maser features. We have measured the annual parallax of the maser sources for the first time in NGC 2264 and derived 1.356 $\pm$ 0.098 mas, corresponding to the distance of 738^{+57}_{-50} pc, which is consistent with its previously reported photometric observations. One of the maser features is located near a dust continuum core, CMM4S, positionally corresponding to the X-ray source FMS2-1269 listed in Flaccomio et al. Re-analyzing Chandra X-ray data, we found that FMS2-1269 is still surrounded by a dense envelope of a H2 column density, 5.4 × 1023 cm-2. We suggest that the maser detected near the CMM4S core is most likely associated with the X-ray-emitting Class 0 candidate FMS2-1269. The other maser feature is found to emerge from a high-velocity outflow of 150 km s-1 and is associated with the 3.6 cm radio continuum source NGC 2264 VLA 3 located close to IRS1.},

	Abstract = {We construct size distributions for carbonaceous and silicate grain populations in different regions of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC. The size distributions include sufficient very small carbonaceous grains (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules) to account for the observed infrared and microwave emission from the diffuse interstellar medium. Our distributions reproduce the observed extinction of starlight, which varies depending on the interstellar environment through which the light travels. As shown by Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis in 1989, these variations can be roughly parameterized by the ratio of visual extinction to reddening, RV. We adopt a fairly simple functional form for the size distribution, characterized by several parameters. We tabulate these parameters for various combinations of values for RV and bC, the C abundance in very small grains. We also find size distributions for the line of sight to HD 210121 and for sight lines in the LMC and SMC. For several size distributions, we evaluate the albedo and scattering asymmetry parameter and present model extinction curves extending beyond the Lyman limit.},

	Abstract = {The origin of bipolar outflow asymmetry in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains poorly understood. It may be due to an intrinsically asymmetric outflow launch mechanism, or it may be caused by the effects of the ambient medium surrounding the YSO. Answering this question is an important step in understanding outflow launching. We have investigated the bipolar outflows driven by the T Tauri star DG Tauri on scales of hundreds of AU, using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini North. The approaching outflow consists of a well-collimated jet, nested within a lower-velocity disc wind. The receding outflow is composed of a single-component bubble-like structure. We analyse the kinemat- ics of the receding outflow using kinetic models, and determine that it is a quasi-stationary bubble with an expanding internal velocity field. We propose that this bubble forms because the receding counterjet from DG Tau is obstructed by a clumpy ambient medium above the circumstellar disc surface, based on similarities between this structure and those found in the modeling of active galactic nuclei outflows. We find evidence of interaction between the obscured counterjet and clumpy ambient material, which we attribute to the large molecular envelope around the DG Tau system. An analytical model of a momentum-driven bubble is shown to be consistent with our interpretation. We conclude that the bipolar outflow from DG Tau is intrinsically symmetric, and the observed asymmetries are due to environmental effects. This mechanism can potentially be used to explain the observed bipolar asymmetries in other YSO outflows.},

	Abstract = {When making use of tabulations of empirical bolometric corrections for stars (BC V ), a commonly overlooked fact is that while the zero point is arbitrary, the bolometric magnitude of the Sun (M bol,sun) that is used in combination with such tables cannot be chosen arbitrarily. It must be consistent with the zero point of BC V  so that the apparent brightness of the Sun is reproduced. The latter is a measured quantity, for which we adopt the value V sun = -26.76 $\pm$ 0.03. Inconsistent values of M bol,sun are listed in many of the most popular sources of BC V . We quantify errors that are introduced by failure to pay attention to this detail. We also take the opportunity to reprint the BC V  coefficients of the often used polynomial fits by Flower, which were misprinted in the original publication.},

@article{ise14a,
	Abstract = {We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 7 mm continuum emission from the disk surrounding the young star LkCa 15. The observations achieve an angular resolution of 70 mas and spatially resolve the circumstellar emission on a spatial scale of 9 AU. The continuum emission traces a dusty annulus of 45 AU in radius that is consistent with the dust morphology observed at shorter wavelengths. The VLA observations also reveal a compact source at the center of the disk, possibly due to thermal emission from hot dust or ionized gas located within a few AU from the central star. No emission is observed between the star and the dusty ring, and, in particular, at the position of the candidate protoplanet LkCa 15 b. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for circumplanetary disk emission, we find that if LkCa~15~b is a massive planet (>5 M_J) accreting at a rate greater than 1.e-6 M_J yr^{-1}, then its circumplanetary disk is less massive than 0.1 M_J, or smaller than 0.4 Hill radii. Similar constraints are derived for any possible circumplanetary disk orbiting within 45 AU from the central star. The mass estimate are uncertain by at least one order of magnitude due to the uncertainties on the mass opacity. Future ALMA observations of this system might be able to detect circumplanetary disks down to a mass of 5.e-4 M_J and as small as 0.2 AU, providing crucial constraints on the presence of giant planets in the act of forming around this young star.},

	Abstract = {We present sub-arcsecond resolution observations of continuum emission associated with the GG Tau quadruple star system at wavelengths of 1.3, 2.8, 7.3, and 50 mm. These data confirm that the GG Tau A binary is encircled by a circumbinary ring at a radius of 235 AU with a FWHM width of ~60 AU. We find no clear evidence for a radial gradient in the spectral shape of the ring, suggesting that the particle size distribution is spatially homogeneous on angular scales of ~0.1". A central point source, likely associated with the primary component (GG Tau Aa), exhibits a composite spectrum from dust and free-free emission. Faint emission at 7.3 mm is observed toward the low-mass star GG Tau Ba, although its origin remains uncertain. Using these measurements of the resolved, multifrequency emission structure of the GG Tau A system, models of the far-infrared to radio spectrum are developed to place constraints on the grain size distribution and dust mass in the circumbinary ring. The non-negligible curvature present in the ring spectrum implies a maximum particle size of 1-10 mm, although we are unable to place strong constraints on the distribution shape. The corresponding dust mass is 30-300 M_earth, at a temperature of 20-30 K. We discuss how this significant concentration of relatively large particles in a narrow ring at a large radius might be produced in a local region of higher gas pressures (i.e., a particle "trap") located near the inner edge of the circumbinary disk.},

	Abstract = {Star formation can be triggered by compression from wind or supernova driven shock waves that sweep over molecular clouds. Because these shocks will likely contain processed elements, triggered star formation has been proposed as an explanation for short lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI) in the Solar System. Previous studies have tracked the triggering event to the earliest phases of collapse and have focused on the shock properties required for both successful star formation and mixing of SLRI's. In this paper, we use Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate the full collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere subjected to a shock and post-shock wind. We track the flow of the cloud material after a star (a sink particle) has formed. For non-rotating clouds we find robust triggered collapse and little bound circumstellar material remaining around the post-shock collapsed core. When we add initial cloud rotation we observe the formation of disks around the collapsed core which then interact with the post-shock flow. Our results indicate that these circumstellar disks are massive enough to form planets and are long-lived, in spite of the ablation driven by post-shock flow ram pressure. As a function of the initial conditions, we also track the time evolution of the accretion rates and particle mixing between between the ambient wind and cloud material. The latter is maximized for cases of highest mach number.},

	Abstract = {The structure of inner region of protoplanetary disks around young pre-main-sequence stars is still poorly understood. This part of the disk is shaped by various forces influencing dust and gas dynamics and by dust sublimation, which creates abrupt drops in the dust density. This region also emits a strong near-infrared excess that cannot be explained by classical accretion disk models, which suggests the existence of some unusual dust distribution or disk shape. The most prevalent explanation to date is the puffed-up inner disk rim model, where the disk exhibits an optically thin cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation. The critical parameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $z_{\rm max}$ relative to the rim's distance from the star $R_{\rm in}$. Observations often require $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}\gtrsim0.2$ to reproduce the near-infrared excess in the spectra. In this paper we put together a comprehensive list of processes that can shape the inner disk rim and combined them together into a self-consistent model. Two of them, radiation pressure force and the gas velocity profile, have never been applied in this context before. The aim was to find the most plausible theoretical values of $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}$. The results show that this value is $\lesssim$0.13 for Herbig Ae stars, $\lesssim$0.11 for T Tau stars and $\lesssim$0.10 for young brown dwarfs. This is below the observational requirements for Herbig Ae stars. We argue that the same problem exists also in T Tau stars. We conclude that the puffed-up inner rim model cannot be the sole explanation for the near-infrared excess in young pre-main-sequence stars.},

	Abstract = {Good representations of the passbands for the Johnson-Cousins UBVRI system have been devised by comparing synthetic photometry with actual observations and with standard system magnitudes. Small adjustments have been made to previously published passbands. Users are urged to match these passbands so that better photometry and calibration are ensured. Mismatched B bands are shown to be a major source of recent (U - B) transformation problems. The nature of systematic differences between the natural colors of the most widely used sets of standard star photometry is investigated and suggested CCD filter combinations are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how the observed large-scale surface magnetic fields of low-mass stars (~0.1 -- 2 Msun), reconstructed through Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI), vary with age t, rotation and X-ray emission. Our sample consists of 104 magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequence objects (1 Myr < t < 10 Gyr). For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that the unsigned average large-scale surface field <|Bv|> is related to age as $t^{-0.655 \pm 0.045}$. This relation has a similar dependence to that identified by Skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. Likewise, our relation could be used as an age-dating method ("magnetochronology"). The trends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism are consistent with the trends found from Zeeman broadening measurements (sensitive to large- and small-scale fields). These similarities indicate that the fields recovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting that small- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generation processes. For the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relations are found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux and rotation period. We attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction, rather than being driven by the dynamo.},

	Abstract = {The formation of stars shapes the structure and evolution of entire galaxies. The rate and efficiency of this process are affected substantially by the density structure of the individual molecular clouds in which stars form. The most fundamental measure of this structure is the probability density function of volume densities (rho-PDF), which determines the star formation rates predicted with analytical models. This function has remained unconstrained by observations. We have developed an approach to quantify rho-PDFs and establish their relation to star formation. The rho-PDFs instigate a density threshold of star formation and allow us to quantify the star formation efficiency above it. The rho-PDFs provide new constraints for star formation theories and correctly predict several key properties of the star-forming interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {RW Aur is a multiple T Tauri system consisting of an early-K type primary (A) and a K5 companion (B) at a separation of 1.4 arcsec. RW Aur A drives a bipolar optical jet that is well-characterized optically. We present results of a sensitive Chandra observation whose primary objective was to search for evidence of soft extended X-ray emission along the jet, as has been seen for a few other nearby T Tauri stars. The binary is clearly resolved by Chandra and both stars are detected as X-ray sources. The X-ray spectra of both stars reveal evidence for cool and hot plasma. Suprisingly, the X-ray luminosity of the less-massive secondary is at least twice that of the primary and is variable. The disparity is attributed to the primary whose X-ray luminosity is at the low end of the range for classical T Tauri stars of similar mass based on established correlations. Deconvolved soft-band images show evidence for slight outward elongation of the source structure of RW Aur A along the blueshifted jet axis inside the central arcsecond. In addition, a faint X-ray emission peak is present on the redshifted axis at an offset of 1.2 +- 0.2 arcsec from the star. Deprojected jet speeds determined from previous optical studies are too low to explain this faint emission peak as shock-heated jet plasma. Thus, unless flow speeds in the redshifted jet have been underestimated, other mechanisms such as magnetic jet heating may be involved.},

	Abstract = {We aim at unveiling the observational imprint of physical mechanisms that govern planetary formation in young, multiple systems. In particular, we investigate the impact of tidal truncation on the inner circumstellar disks. We observed the emblematic system GG Tau at high-angular resolution: a hierarchical quadruple system composed of low-mass T Tauri binary stars surrounded by a well-studied, massive circumbinary disk in Keplerian rotation. We used the near-IR 4-telescope combiner PIONIER on the VLTI and sparse-aperture-masking techniques on VLT/NaCo to probe this proto-planetary system at sub-AU scales. We report the discovery of a significant closure-phase signal in H and Ks bands that can be reproduced with an additional low-mass companion orbiting GG Tau Ab, at a (projected) separation rho = 31.7 +/- 0.2mas (4.4 au) and PA = 219.6 +/- 0.3deg. This finding offers a simple explanation for several key questions in this system, including the missing-stellar-mass problem and the asymmetry of continuum emission from the inner dust disks observed at millimeter wavelengths. Composed of now five co-eval stars with 0.02 <= Mstar <= 0.7 Msun, the quintuple system GG Tau has become an ideal test case to constrain stellar evolution models at young ages (few 10^6yr).},

	Abstract = {Observations with {\em RHESSI} have enabled the detailed study of the structure of dense hard X-ray coronal sources in solar flares. The variation of source extent with electron energy has been discussed in the context of streaming of non-thermal particles in a one-dimensional cold-target model, and the results used to constrain both the physical extent of, and density within, the electron acceleration region. Here we extend this investigation to a more physically realistic model of electron transport that takes into account the finite temperature of the ambient plasma, the initial pitch-angle distribution of the accelerated electrons, and the effects of collisional pitch-angle scattering. The finite temperature results in the thermal diffusion of electrons, that leads to the observationally-inferred value of the acceleration region volume being an overestimate of its true value. The different directions of the electron trajectories, a consequence of both the non-zero injection pitch-angle and scattering within the target, cause the projected propagation distance parallel to the guiding magnetic field to be reduced, so that a one-dimensional interpretation can overestimate the actual density by a factor of up to $\sim 6$. The implications of these results for the determination of acceleration region properties (specific acceleration rate, filling factor, etc.) are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Most stars form in a clustered environment. Therefore, it is important to assess how this environment influences the evolution of protoplanetary discs around young stars. In turn, this affects their ability to produce planets and ultimately life. We present here for the first time 3D SPH/N-body simulations that include both the hydrodynamical evolution of the discs around their natal stars, as well as the dynamics of the stars themselves. The discs are viscously evolving, accreting mass onto the central star and spreading. We find penetrating encounters to be very destructive for the discs as in previous studies, although the frequency of such encounters is low. We also find, however, that encounter influence the disc radii more strongly than other disc properties such as the disc mass. The disc sizes are set by the competition between viscous spreading and the disruptive effect of encounters. As discs spread, encounters become more and more important. In the regime of rapid spreading encounters simply truncate the discs, stripping the outer portions. In the opposite regime, we find that the effect of many distant encounters is able to limit the disc size. Finally, we predict from our simulations that disc sizes are limited by encounters at stellar densities exceeding $\sim 2-3 \times 10^3 \ \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$.},

	Abstract = {We present ALMA 880 micron continuum observations of 20 K and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius OB association that are surrounded by protoplanetary disks. These data are used to measure the dust content in disks around low mass stars (0.1-1.6 Msun) at a stellar age of 5-11 Myr. Thirteen sources were detected in the 880 micron dust continuum at >3 sigma with inferred dust masses between 0.3 and 52 Mearth. The dust masses tend to be higher around the more massive stars, but the significance is marginal in that the probability of no correlation is p ~ 0.03. The evolution in the dust content in disks was assessed by comparing the Upper Sco observations with published continuum measurements of disks around ~ 1-2 Myr stars in the Class II stage in the Taurus molecular cloud. While the dust masses in the Upper Sco disks are on average lower than in Taurus, any difference in the dust mass distributions is significant at less than 3sigma. For stellar masses between 0.49 Msun and 1.6 Msun, the mean dust mass in disks is lower in Upper Sco relative to Taurus by Delta log Mdust = 0.44 +/-0.26.},

	Abstract = {We present an integrated thermal-chemical model for the atmosphere of the inner region of a protoplanetary disk that includes irradiation by both far ultraviolet (FUV) and X-ray radiation. We focus on how the photodissociation of water and OH affects the abundances of these and related species and how it contributes to the heating of the atmosphere. The dust in the atmosphere plays several important roles, primarily as the site of H$_2$ formation and by absorbing the FUV. Large amounts of water can be synthesized within the inner 4 AU of a disk around a typical classical T~Tauri star. OH is found primarily at the top of a warm region where the gas temperature is $T_g \approx 650 - 1000$ K and water below it where the temperature is lower, $T_g \approx 250 - 650$ K. The amounts of water and OH and the temperatures of the regions in which they formed are in agreement with recent Spitzer measurements and support the notion of it in situ production of water in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. We find that the synthesized water is effective in shielding the disk midplane from stellar FUV radiation.},

	Abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provide a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. These relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and the photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main-sequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period is determined by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from two complementary analyses. Global photometric levels of magnetic activity in this sample of stars are also extracted by using a photometric activity index, which takes into account the rotation period of the stars. Out of the 540 solar-like pulsating stars in our sample, we successfully measured the rotation period of 310 stars (excluding known binaries and candidate planet host stars). The rotation periods lay between 1 and 100 days. The remaining stars are classified into two categories: those not showing any surface rotation (6 stars), and those in which the four analyses did not converge to a single and robust rotation period (213). The photometric magnetic activity levels were computed and for 61.5% of the dwarfs, its value is comparable to the solar one. We then extract an age-rotation relation only for the dwarfs with very precise asteroseismic age estimations, highlighting the necessity of excluding the hot stars and the subgiants when inferring such relations. We also studied age-activity-rotation relations with a hint of correlation for the subgiants.},

	Abstract = {Observations of protoplanetary disks show that some characteristics seem recurrent, even in star formation regions that are physically distant such as surface mass density profiles varying as $r^{-1}$, or aspect ratios about 0.03 to 0.23. Accretion rates are also recurrently found around $10^{-8} - 10^{-6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ for disks already evolved (Isella et al., 2009, Andrews et al., 2009, 2010). Several models have been developed in order to recover these properties. However, most of them usually simplify the disk geometry if not its mid-plane temperature. This has major consequences for modeling the disk evolution over million years and consequently planet migration. In the present paper, we develop a viscous evolution hydrodynamical numerical code that determines simultaneously the disk photosphere geometry and the mid-plane temperature. We then compare our results of long-term simulations with similar simulations of disks with a constrained geometry along the Chiang & Goldreich (1997) prescription (dlnH/dlnr = 9/7). We find that the constrained geometry models provide a good approximation of the disk surface density evolution. However, they differ significantly regarding the temperature time evolution. In addition, we find that shadowed regions naturally appear at the transition between viscously dominated and radiation dominated regions that falls in the region of planetary formation. We show that $\chi$ (photosphere height to pressure scale height ratio) cannot be considered as a constant, consistently with Watanabe et al. (2008). Comparisons with observations show that all disk naturally evolve toward a shallow surface density disk ($\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$). The mass flux across the disk stabilizes in about 1 million year typically.},

	Abstract = {An instability can potentially operate in highly irradiated disks where the disk sharply transitions from being radially transparent to opaque (the 'transition region'). Such conditions may exist at the inner edges of transitional disks around T Tauri stars and accretion disks around AGNs. We derive the criterion for this instability, which we term the 'irradiation instability', or IRI. We also present the linear growth rate as a function of beta, the ratio between radiation force and gravity, and c_s, the sound speed of the disk, obtained using two methods: a semi-analytic analysis of the linearized equations and a numerical simulation using the GPU-accelerated hydrodynamical code PEnGUIn. In particular, we find that IRI occurs at beta~0.1 if the transition region extends as wide as ~0.05r, and at higher beta values if it is wider. Furthermore, in the nonlinear evolution of the instability, disks with a large beta and small c_s exhibit 'clumping': extreme local surface density enhancements, reaching a few tens of the initial disk surface density.},

	Abstract = {Variability in emission lines is a characteristic feature in young stars and can be used as a tool to study the physics of the accretion process. Here we present a study of H{\alpha} variability in 15 T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars (K7-B2) over a wide range of time windows, from minutes, to hours, to days, and years. We assess the variability using linewidth measurements and the time series of line profiles. All objects show gradual, slow profile changes on time-scales of days. In addition, in three cases there is evidence for rapid variations in H{\alpha} with typical time-scales of 10 min, which occurs in 10% of the total covered observing time. The mean accretion-rate changes, inferred from the line fluxes,are 0.01-0.07 dex for time-scales of < 1 hour, 0.04-0.4 dex for time-scales of days, and 0.13-0.52 dex for time-scales of years. In Costigan et al. 2012 we derived an upper limit finding that the intermediate (days) variability dominated over longer (years) variability. Here our new results, based on much higher cadence observations, also provide a lower limit to accretion-rate variability on similar time-scales (days), thereby constraining the accretion rate variability physics in a much more definitive way. A plausible explanation for the gradual variations over days is an asymmetric accretion flow resulting in a rotational modulation of the accretion-related emission, although other interpretations are possible as well. In conjunction with our previous work, we find that the time-scales and the extent of the variability is similar for objects ranging in mass from ~ 0.1 to ~ 5 Msol. This confirms that a single mode of accretion is at work from T Tauri to Herbig Ae stars - across a wide range of stellar masses.},

	Abstract = {The strength and structure of the large-scale magnetic field in protoplanetary discs are still unknown, although they could have important consequences for the dynamics and evolution of the disc. Using a mean-field approach in which we model the effects of turbulence through enhanced diffusion coefficients, we study the time-evolution of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field in a global model of a thin accretion disc, with particular attention to protoplanetary discs. With the transport coefficients usually assumed, the magnetic field strength does not significantly increase radially inwards, leading to a relatively weak magnetic field in the inner part of the disc. We show that with more realistic transport coefficients that take into account the vertical structure of the disc and the back-reaction of the magnetic field on the flow as obtained by Guilet & Ogilvie (2012), the magnetic field can significantly increase radially inwards. The magnetic-field profile adjusts to reach an equilibrium value of the plasma $\beta$ parameter (the ratio of midplane thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) in the inner part of the disc. This value of $\beta$ depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the disc and on the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, and lies in the range $10^4-10^7$ for protoplanetary discs. Such a magnetic field is expected to affect significantly the dynamics of protoplanetary discs by increasing the strength of MHD turbulence and launching an outflow. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of protoplanetary discs and for the formation of powerful jets as observed in T-Tauri star systems.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R = 80,000) spectroscopy of [Ne II] emission from two young stars, GM Aur and AA Tau, which have moderate to high inclinations. The emission from both sources appears centered near the stellar velocity and is broader than the [Ne II] emission measured previously for the face-on disk system TW Hya. These properties are consistent with a disk origin for the [Ne II] emission we detect, with disk rotation (rather than photoevaporation or turbulence in a hot disk atmosphere) playing the dominant role in the origin of the line width. In the non-face-on systems, the [Ne II] emission is narrower than the CO fundamental emission from the same sources. If the widths of both diagnostics are dominated by Keplerian rotation, this suggests that the [Ne II] emission arises from larger disk radii on average than does the CO emission. The equivalent width of the [Ne II] emission we detect is less than that of the spectrally unresolved [Ne II] feature in the Spitzer spectra of the same sources. Variability in the [Ne II] emission or the mid-infrared continuum, a spatially extended [Ne II] component, or a very (spectrally) broad [Ne II] component might account for the difference in the equivalent widths.

@article{pil14,
	Abstract = {Abridged. Here we report on the X-ray activity of the primary star, HD189733 A, using a new XMM-Newton observation and a comparison with the previous X-ray observations. The spectrum in the quiescent intervals is described by two temperatures at 0.2 keV and 0.7 keV, while during the flares a third component at 0.9 keV is detected. We obtain estimates of the electron density in the range $n_e = 1.6 - 13 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and thus the corona of HD189733 A appears denser than the solar one. {For the third time, we observe a large flare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. Together with the flares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a small planetary phase range of $\phi = 0.55-0.65$. Although we do not find conclusive evidence of a significant excess of flares after the secondary transits, we suggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes close to locally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinations of stellar rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. For the most recent flares, a wavelet analysis of the light curve suggests a loop of length of four stellar radii at the location of the bright flare, and a local magnetic field of order of 40-100 G, in agreement with the global field measured in other studies. The loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature between planet and star, separated by only $\sim8 R_*$. We also detect the stellar companion (HD 189733 B, $\sim12"$ from the primary star) in this XMM observation. Its very low X-ray luminosity ($L_X = 3.4\times 10^{26}$ erg s$^{-1}$) confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. The high activity of the primary star is best explained by a transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the star.}},

	Abstract = {Strong, kilo-Gauss, magnetic fields are required to explain a range of observational properties in young, accreting pre-main sequence (PMS) systems. We review the techniques used to detect magnetic fields in PMS stars. Key results from a long running campaign aimed at characterising the large scale magnetic fields in accreting T Tauri stars are presented. Maps of surface magnetic flux in these systems can be used to build 3-D models exploring the role of magnetic fields and the efficiency with which magnetic fields can channel accretion from circumstellar disks on to young stars. Long-term variability in T Tauri star magnetic fields strongly point to a dynamo origin of the magnetic fields. Studies are underway to quantify how changes in magnetic fields affect their accretion properties. We also present the first results from a new programme that investigates the evolution of magnetic fields in intermediate mass (1.5-3 Msun) pre-main sequence stars as they evolve from being convective T Tauri stars to fully radiative Herbig AeBe stars.},

	Abstract = {The far-ultraviolet (FUV; 912--1700 \AA) radiation field from accreting central stars in Classical T Tauri systems influences the disk chemistry during the period of giant planet formation. Previous efforts to measure the true stellar+accretion-generated FUV luminosity (both hot gas emission lines and continua) have been complicated by a combination of low-sensitivity and/or low-spectral resolution and did not include the contribution from the bright Ly$\alpha$ emission line. In this work, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic study of the FUV radiation fields of 16 T Tauri stars whose dust disks display a range of evolutionary states. We include reconstructed Ly$\alpha$ line profiles and remove atomic and molecular disk emission (from H$_{2}$ and CO fluorescence) to provide robust measurements of both the FUV continuum and hot gas lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, \ion{N}{5}, \ion{C}{4}, \ion{He}{2}) for an appreciable sample of T Tauri stars for the first time. We find that the flux of the typical Classical T Tauri Star FUV radiation field at 1 AU from the central star is $\sim$ 10$^{7}$ times the average interstellar radiation field. The Ly$\alpha$ emission line contributes an average of 88% of the total FUV flux, with the FUV continuum accounting for an average of 8%. Both the FUV continuum and Ly$\alpha$ flux are strongly correlated with \ion{C}{4} flux, suggesting that accretion processes dominate the production of both of these components. On average, only $\sim$ 0.5% of the total FUV flux is emitted between the Lyman limit (912 \AA) and the H$_{2}$ (0 -- 0) absorption band at 1110 \AA. The total and component-level high-resolution radiation fields are made publicly available in machine-readable format.},

	Abstract = {We present the first X-ray observation of an oscillation during a stellar flare. The flare occurred on the active M-type dwarf AT Mic and was observed with XMM-Newton. The soft X-ray light curve (0.2-12 keV) is investigated with wavelet analysis. The flare's extended, flat peak shows clear evidence for a damped oscillation with a period of around 750 s, an exponential damping time of around 2000 s, and an initial, relative peak-to-peak amplitude of around 15%. We suggest that the oscillation is a standing magneto-acoustic wave tied to the flare loop, and find that the most likely interpretation is a longitudinal, slow-mode wave, with a resulting loop length of (2.5 $\pm$ 0.2)×1010 cm. The local magnetic field strength is found to be 105 $\pm$ 50 G. These values are consistent with (oscillation-independent) flare cooling time models and pressure balance scaling laws. Such a flare oscillation provides an excellent opportunity to obtain coronal properties like the size of a flare loop or the local magnetic field strength for the otherwise spatially-unresolved star.},

	Abstract = {The temporal decay of mass accretion in young stars is a fundamental tracer of the early evolution of circumstellar disks. Through population syntheses, we study how correlated uncertainties between the estimated parameters of young stars (luminosity, temperature, mass, age) and mass accretion rates Mdot, as well as observational selection effects, can bias the temporal decay of mass accretion rates (Mdot t^-eta) inferred from a comparison of measured Mdot with isochronal ages in young stellar clusters. We find that the presence of realistic uncertainties reduces the measured value of eta by up to a factor of 3, leading to the inference of shallower decays than the true value. This suggests a much faster temporal decay of Mdot than generally assumed. When considering the minimum uncertainties in ages affecting the Orion Nebula Cluster, the observed value eta~1.4, typical of Galactic star forming regions, can only be reproduced if the real decay exponent is eta>4. This effect becomes more severe if one assumes that observational uncertainties are larger, as required by some fast star formation scenarios. Our analysis shows that while selection effects due to sample incompleteness do bias eta, they can not alter this main result and strengthen it in many cases. A remaining uncertainty in our work is that it applies to the most commonly used and simple relationship between Mdot, the accretion luminosity and the stellar parameters. We briefly explore how a more complex interplay between these quantities might change the results.},

	Abstract = {Zeeman-Doppler imaging is a spectropolarimetric technique that is used to map the large-scale surface magnetic fields of stars. These maps in turn are used to study the structure of the stars' coronae and winds. This method, however, misses any small-scale magnetic flux whose polarisation signatures cancel out. Measurements of Zeeman broadening show that a large percentage of the surface magnetic flux may be neglected in this way. In this paper we assess the impact of this 'missing flux' on the predicted coronal structure and the possible rates of spin down due to the stellar wind. To do this we create a model for the small-scale field and add this to the Zeeman-Doppler maps of the magnetic fields of a sample of 12 M dwarfs. We extrapolate this combined field and determine the structure of a hydrostatic, isothermal corona. The addition of small-scale surface field produces a carpet of low-lying magnetic loops that covers most of the surface, including the stellar equivalent of solar 'coronal holes' where the large-scale field is opened up by the stellar wind and hence would be X-ray dark. We show that the trend of the X-ray emission measure with rotation rate (the so-called 'activity-rotation relation') is unaffected by the addition of small-scale field, when scaled with respect to the large-scale field of each star. The addition of small-scale field increases the surface flux; however, the large-scale open flux that governs the loss of mass and angular momentum in the wind remains unaffected. We conclude that spin-down times and mass loss rates calculated from surface magnetograms are unlikely to be significantly influenced by the neglect of small-scale field.},

	Abstract = {We discuss ASASSN-13db, an EXor accretion event on the young stellar object (YSO) SDSS J051011.01$-$032826.2 (hereafter SDSSJ0510) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Using archival photometric data of SDSSJ0510 we construct a pre-outburst spectral energy distribution (SED) and find that it is consistent with a low-mass class II YSO near the Orion star forming region ($d \sim 420$ pc). We present follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations of the source after the $\Delta V \sim-$3.7 mag outburst that began in September 2013. These data indicate an increase in temperature and luminosity consistent with an accretion rate of $\sim10^{-7}$ $\rm{M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, three-to-five orders of magnitude greater than in quiescence. Spectroscopic observations show a forest of narrow emission lines dominated by neutral metallic lines from Fe I and some low-ionization lines. The properties of ASASSN-13db are similar to those of the EXor prototype EX~Lupi in late 2008 during its strongest observed outburst.},

	Abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are the sites of planet formation, and the evolution and eventual dispersal of these disks strongly influences the formation of planetary systems. Disk evolution during the planet-forming epoch is driven by accretion and mass-loss due to winds, and in typical environments photoevaporation by high-energy radiation from the central star is likely to dominate final gas disk dispersal. We present a critical review of current theoretical models, and discuss the observations that are used to test these models and inform our understanding of the underlying physics. We also discuss the role disk dispersal plays in shaping planetary systems, considering its influence on both the process(es) of planet formation and the architectures of planetary systems. We conclude by presenting a schematic picture of protoplanetary disk evolution and dispersal, and discussing prospects for future work.},

	Abstract = {I review the processes that shape the evolution of protoplanetary discs around young, solar-mass stars. I first discuss observations of protoplanetary discs, and note in particular the constraints these observations place on models of disc evolution. The processes that affect the evolution of gas discs are then discussed, with the focus in particular on viscous accretion and photoevaporation, and recent models which combine the two. I then discuss the dynamics and growth of dust grains in discs, considering models of grain growth, the gas-grain interaction and planetesimal formation, and review recent research in this area. Lastly, I consider the so-called "transitional" discs, which are thought to be observed during disc dispersal. Recent observations and models of these systems are reviewed, and prospects for using statistical surveys to distinguish between the various proposed models are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We review advances in the modeling of protoplanetary disks. This review will focus on the regions of the disk beyond the dust sublimation radius, i.e., beyond 0.1-1 AU, depending on the stellar luminosity. We will be mostly concerned with models that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick disks, these parameters include the accretion rate through the disk onto the star, the geometry of the disk, the dust properties, the surface chemistry, and the thermal balance of the gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple and a photoevaporative flow may originate. We also briefly discuss optically thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not the dust. The evolution of these disks is dominated by accretion, viscous spreading, photoevaporation, and dust settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure arising from the surface layer models provide input to models of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We discuss the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution and planet formation.},

@article{mat13a,
	Abstract = {The study of stellar activity is important because it can provide new constraints for dynamo models, when combined with surface rotation rates and the depth of the convection zone. We know that the dynamo mechanism, which is believed to be the main process to rule the magnetic cycle of solar-like stars at least, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation, convection, and magnetic field. The Kepler mission has been collecting data for a large number of stars during 4 years allowing us to investigate magnetic stellar cycles. We investigated the Kepler light curves to look for magnetic activity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. Based on the photometric data we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magnetic activity of the stars. We selected a sample of 22 solar-like F stars that have a rotation period smaller than 12 days. We performed a time-frequency analysis using the Morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy. We computed the magnetic index S_ph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index <S_ph> that is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of length five times the rotation period of the star. We defined new indicators to take into account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for all the stars, such as the contrast between high and low activity. We also inferred the Rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. This analysis shows different types of behaviours in the 22 F stars. Two stars show behaviours very similar to magnetic activity cycles. Five stars show long-lived spots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. Two stars of our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in the temporal variation of the magnetic proxies. Finally the last group of stars show magnetic activity (with presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.},

These stars are located in the region of young open star clusters NGC 869 and IC 2602. These flares detected in the XMM-Newton data show a rapid rise (10-40 minutes) and a slow decay (20-90 minutes). The X-ray luminosities during the flares in the energy band 0.3-7.5 keV are in the range of $10^{29.9}$ to $10^{31.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The strongest flare was observed with the ratio $\sim 13$ for count rates at peak of the flare to the quiescent intensity. The maximum temperature during the flares has been found to be $\sim$100 MK. The semi loop lengths for the flaring loops are estimated to be of the order of $\rm{10^{10}}$ cm. The physical parameters of the flaring structure, the peak density, pressure, and minimum magnetic field required to confine the plasma have been derived and found to be consistent with flares from pre-main sequence stars in the Orion and the Taurus-Auriga-Perseus region.},

	Abstract = {According to the magnetospheric accretion scenario, young low-mass stars are surrounded by circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion of mass. The accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power the mass outflows, which may in turn have a significant role in removing the excess angular momentum from the star-disk system. Although the process of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully understood. On the other hand, strong flaring activity is a common feature of young stellar objects (YSOs). In the Sun, such events give rise to perturbations of the interplanetary medium. Similar but more energetic phenomena occur in YSOs and may influence the circumstellar environment. In fact, a recent study has shown that an intense flaring activity close to the disk may strongly perturb the stability of circumstellar disks, thus inducing mass accretion episodes (Orlando et al. 2011). Here we review the main results obtained in the field and the future perspectives.},

	Abstract = {We analyse current measurements of accretion rates onto pre-main sequence stars as a function of stellar mass, and conclude that the steep dependance of accretion rates on stellar mass is real and not driven by selection/detection threshold, as has been previously feared. These conclusions are reached by means of statistical tests including a survival analysis which can account for upper limits. The power-law slope of the Mdot-M* relation is found to be in the range of 1.6-1.9 for young stars with masses lower than 1 Msun. The measured slopes and distributions can be easily reproduced by means of a simple disc model which includes viscous accretion and X-ray photoevaporation. We conclude that the Mdot-M* relation in pre-main sequence stars bears the signature of disc dispersal by X-ray photoevaporation, suggesting that the relation is a straight- forward consequence of disc physics rather than an imprint of initial conditions.},

	Abstract = {We present a model for the radiative output of star clusters in the process of star formation suitable for use in hydrodynamical simulations of radiative feedback. Gas in a clump, defined as a region whose density exceeds 10^4 cm^-3, is converted to stars via the random sampling of the Chabrier IMF. A star formation efficiency controls the rate of star formation. We have completed a suite of simulations which follow the evolution of accretion-fed clumps with initial masses ranging from 0 to 10^5 M_sol and accretion rates ranging from 10^-5 to 10^-1 M_sol yr^-1. The stellar content is tracked over time which allows the aggregate luminosity, ionizing photon rate, number of stars, and star formation rate (SFR) to be determined. For a fiducial clump of 10^4 M_sol, the luminosity is ~4x10^6 L_sol with a SFR of roughly 3x10^-3 M_sol yr^-1. We identify two regimes in our model. The accretion-dominated regime obtains the majority of its gas through accretion and is characterized by an increasing SFR while the reservoir-dominated regime has the majority of its mass present in the initial clump with a decreasing SFR. We show that our model can reproduce the expected number of O stars, which dominate the radiative output of the cluster. We find a nearly linear relationship between SFR and mass as seen in observations. We conclude that our model is an accurate and straightforward way to represent the output of clusters in hydrodynamical simulations with radiative feedback.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of ~102-104 higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an alpha-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter alpha = 10-3 are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (alpha = 10-2) disks are dispersed within ~0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than ~100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

	Abstract = {X-ray emission is characteristic of young stellar objects (YSOs) and is known to be highly variable. We investigate, via a multiwavelength IR/X-ray study of the L1630 dark cloud, whether and how X-ray variability in young stellar objects is related to protostellar evolutionary state. We have analyzed 11 Chandra X-ray Observatory observations, obtained over the course of four years and totaling ~240 ks exposure time, targeting the eruptive Class I YSO V1647 Ori in L1630. We used 2MASS and Spitzer data to identify and classify IR counterparts to L1630 X-ray sources and identified a total of 52 X-ray emitting YSOs with IR counterparts, including 4 Class I sources and 1 Class 0/I source. We have detected cool (< 3 MK) plasma, possibly indicative of accretion shocks, in three classical T Tauri stars. A subsample of 27 X-ray-emitting YSOs were covered by 9 of the 11 Chandra observations targeting V1647 Ori and vicinity. For these 27 YSOs, we have constructed X-ray light curves spanning approximately four years. These light curves highlight the variable nature of pre-main sequence X-ray emitting young stars; many of the L1630 YSOs vary by orders of magnitude in count rate between observations. We discuss possible scenarios to explain apparent trends between various X-ray spectral properties, X-ray variance and YSO classification.},

	Abstract = {Young low-mass stars are characterized by ejection of collimated outflows and by circumstellar discs which they interact with through accretion of mass. The accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power the mass outflows, which may in turn remove the excess angular momentum from the star-disc system. However, although the process of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully understood. A point not considered to date and relevant for the accretion process is the evidence of very energetic and frequent flaring events in these stars. Flares may easily perturb the stability of the discs, thus influencing the transport of mass and angular momentum. Here we report on 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the evolution of a flare with an idealized non-equilibrium initial condition occurring near the disc around a rotating magnetized star. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the gravitational force, the viscosity of the disc, the magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation), the radiative losses from optically thin plasma and the coronal heating. We show that, during its first stage of evolution, the flare gives rise to a hot magnetic loop linking the disc to the star. The disc is strongly perturbed by the flare: disc material evaporates under the effect of the thermal conduction and an overpressure wave propagates through the disc. When the overpressure reaches the opposite side of the disc, a funnel flow starts to develop there, accreting substantial disc material on to the young star from the side of the disc opposite to the flare.},

	Abstract = {We derive hydrostatic, radiative equilibrium models for passive disks surrounding T Tauri stars. Each disk is encased by an optically thin layer of superheated dust grains. This layer reemits directly to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs. The other half is emitted inward and regulates the interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the spectral energy distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than an order of magnitude greater radius. Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly face-on.},

@article{gar07,
	Abstract = {In theory of accretion disks, angular momentum and mass transfer are associated with the generation of energy through viscous dissipation. In the construction of SED models of protostellar disks, the stellar irradiation is usually assumed to be the dominant heating source. Here we construct a new set of self-consistent analytical disk models by taking into account both sources of thermal energy and the thermal structure of the disk across the midplane. We deduce a set of general formulae for the relationship between the mass accretion rate and the surface density profile. We apply it to determine the structure of protostellar disks under a state of steady accretion and derive the radial distribution of surface density and midplane temperature. The incorporation of the viscous heating in our model reduces the disk flaring angle and leads to lower photospheric temperatures than previously thought. Around T Tauri stars, the snow line can evolve from outside 10 AU during FU Orionis outbursts, to 2 AU during the quasi-steady accretion phase, to 0.7 AU when the accretion rate falls to about 10-9 Msolar yr-1, and finally reexpand beyond 2.2 AU during the protostellar-to-debris disk transition. The nonmonotonous evolution of the snow line may lead to the observed isotopic composition of water on both Venus and Earth. We also infer the presence of a marginally opaque, isothermal region with a surface density distribution similar to that of the MSN model. With a 40% higher temperature than that in the region immediately within, this transition may lead to an upturn in the SEDs in the MIR (24-70 mum) wavelength range. The optically thin, outermost regions of the disk have a shallow surface density profile of the dust that is consistent with millimeter observations of spatially resolved disks.},

@article{ke12,
	Abstract = {Spectral energy distribution (SED) in protostellar disks is determined by the disks' internal dissipation and reprocessing of irradiation from their host stars. Around T Tauri stars, most mid-infrared (MIR) radiation (in a wavelength range from a few to a few tens of mum) emerges from regions around a fraction to a few AU. This region is interesting because it contains both the habitable zone and the snow line. Recent observations reveal SED variations in the MIR wavelength range. These variations are puzzling because they occur on a timescale (a few days) which is much shorter than the dynamical (months to years) timescale from 1 AU to a few AU. They are probably caused by shadows cast by inner onto outer disk regions. Interaction between disks and their misaligned magnetized host stars can lead to warped structure and periodic SED modulations. Rapid aperiodic SED variations may also be induced by observed X-ray flares from T Tauri stars. These flares can significantly modulate the ionization fraction of the gas and the net charge carried by the grains near the surface of the inner disk. The newly charged grains may be accelerated by the stellar or disk magnetic field and adjust their distances from the midplane. Shadows cast by these grains attenuate the flux of stellar photons irradiated onto regions at several AU from the central stars. We use this model to account for the observed rapid aperiodic SED variabilities. We suggest that regular monitoring of SED variations will not only provide valuable information on the distribution of the disk aspect ratio near the habitable zone but also provide a probe of the interaction between the inner regions of the disk with the magnetosphere of their host stars.},

@article{gla12,
	Abstract = {Cosmic-ray and X-ray heating are derived from the electron energy-loss calculations of Dalgarno, Yan, and Liu for hydrogen-helium gas mixtures. These authors treated the heating from elastic scattering and collisional de-excitation of rotationally excited hydrogen molecules. Here we consider the heating that can arise from all ionization and excitation processes, with particular emphasis on the reactions of cosmic-ray and X-ray generated ions with the heavy neutral species, which we refer to as chemical heating. In molecular regions, chemical heating dominates and can account for 50% of the energy expended in the creation of an ion pair. The heating per ion pair ranges in the limit of negligible electron fraction from ~4.3 eV for diffuse atomic gas to ~13 eV for the moderately dense regions of molecular clouds and to ~18 eV for the very dense regions of protoplanetary disks. An important general conclusion of this study is that cosmic-ray and X-ray heating depends on the physical properties of the medium, i.e., on the molecular and electron fractions, the total density of hydrogen nuclei, and, to a lesser extent, on the temperature. It is also noted that chemical heating, the dominant process for cosmic-ray and X-ray heating, plays a role in UV irradiated molecular gas.},

	Abstract = {LkCa 15 in the Taurus star-forming region has recently gained attention as the first accreting T Tauri star likely to host a young protoplanet. High spatial resolution infrared observations have detected the suspected protoplanet within a dust-depleted inner gap of the LkCa 15 transition disk at a distance of ~15 AU from the star. If this object's status as a protoplanet is confirmed, then LkCa 15 will serve as a unique laboratory for constraining physical conditions within a planet-forming disk. Previous models of the LkCa 15 disk have accounted for disk heating by the stellar photosphere but have ignored the potential importance of X-ray ionization and heating. We report here the detection of LkCa 15 as a bright X-ray source with Chandra. The X-ray emission is characterized by a cool, heavily absorbed plasma component at kT cool ≈ 0.3 keV and a harder component at kT hot ≈ 5 keV. We use the observed X-ray properties to provide initial estimates of the X-ray ionization and heating rates within the tenuous inner disk. These estimates and the observed X-ray properties of LkCa 15 can be used as a starting point for developing more realistic disk models of this benchmark system.},

	Abstract = {We examine substructure and mass segregation in the massive OB association Cygnus OB2 to better understand its initial conditions. Using a well understood Chandra X-ray selected sample of young stars we find that Cyg OB2 exhibits considerable physical substructure and has no evidence for mass segregation, both indications that the association is not dynamically evolved. Combined with previous kinematical studies we conclude that Cyg OB2 is dynamically very young, and what we observe now is very close to its initial conditions: Cyg OB2 formed as a highly substructured, unbound association with a low volume density (< 100 stars/pc^3). This is inconsistent with the idea that all stars form in dense, compact clusters. The massive stars in Cyg OB2 show no evidence for having formed particularly close to one another, nor in regions of higher than average density. Since Cyg OB2 contains stars as massive as ~100 Mo this result suggests that very massive stars can be born in relatively low-density environments. This would imply that the massive stars in Cyg OB2 did not form by competitive accretion, or by mergers.},

	Abstract = {We report JVLA 8-10 GHz ($\lambda$=3.0-3.7 cm) monitoring observations toward the YSO cluster R Coronae Australis (R\,CrA), taken in 2012, from March 15 to September 12. These observations were planned to measure the radio flux variabilities in timescales from 0.5 hours to several days, to tens of days, and up to $\sim$200 days. We found that among the YSOs detectable in individual epochs, in general, the most reddened objects in the \textit{Spitzer} observations show the highest mean 3.5 cm Stokes \textit{I} emission, and the lowest fractional variabilities on $<$200-day timescales. The brightest radio flux emitters in our observations are the two reddest sources IRS7W and IRS7E. In addition, by comparing with observations taken in 1996-1998 and 2005, we found that the radio fluxes of these two sources have increased by a factor $\sim$1.5. The mean 3.5-cm fluxes of the three Class I/II sources IRSI, IRS2, and IRS6 appear to be correlated with their accretion rates derived by a previous near infrared line survey. The weakly accreting Class I/II YSOs, or those in later evolutionary stages, present radio flux variability on $<$0.5-hour timescales. Some YSOs were detected only during occasional flaring events. The source R\,CrA went below our detection limit during a few fading events.},

	Abstract = {The circumstellar environments of classical T Tauri stars are challenging to directly image because of their high star-to-disk contrast ratio. One method to overcome this is by using imaging polarimetry where scattered and consequently polarised starlight from the star's circumstellar disk can be separated from the unpolarised light of the central star. We present images of the circumstellar environment of SU Aur, a classical T Tauri star at the transition of T Tauri to Herbig stars. The images directly show that the disk extends out to ~500 au with an inclination angle of $\sim$ 50$^\circ$. Using interpretive models, we derived very small grains in the surface layers of its disk, with a very steep size- and surface-density distribution. Additionally, we resolved a large and extended nebulosity in our images that is most likely a remnant of the prenatal molecular cloud. The position angle of the disk, determined directly from our images, rules out a polar outflow or jet as the cause of this large-scale nebulosity.},

	Abstract = {The Suzaku X-ray satellite observed the young stellar object (YSO) V1647 Ori on 2008 October 8 during the new mass accretion outburst reported in 2008 August. During the 87 ks observation with a net exposure of 40 ks, V1647 Ori showed a high level of X-ray emission with a gradual decrease in flux by a factor of 5 and then displayed an abrupt flux increase by an order of magnitude. Such enhanced X-ray variability was also seen in XMM-Newton observations in 2004 and 2005 during the 2003-2005 outburst, but has rarely been observed for other YSOs. The spectrum clearly displays emission from Helium-like iron, which is a signature of hot plasma (kT ~ 5 keV). It also shows a fluorescent iron Kalpha line with a remarkably large equivalent width (EW) of ~600 eV. Such a large EW suggests that a part of the incident X-ray emission that irradiates the circumstellar material and/or the stellar surface is hidden from our line of sight. XMM-Newton spectra during the 2003-2005 outburst did not show a strong fluorescent iron Kalpha line, so that the structure of the circumstellar gas very close to the stellar core that absorbs and re-emits X-ray emission from the central object may have changed in between 2005 and 2008. This phenomenon may be related to changes in the infrared morphology of McNeil's nebula between 2004 and 2008.},

	Abstract = {Eclipsing binaries (EBs) provide critical laboratories for empirically testing predictions of theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution. Pre-main-sequence (PMS) EBs are particularly valuable, both due to their rarity and the highly dynamic nature of PMS evolution, such that a dense grid of PMS EBs is required to properly calibrate theoretical PMS models. Analyzing multi-epoch, multi-color light curves for ~2400 candidate Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) members from our Warm Spitzer Exploration Science Program YSOVAR, we have identified 12 stars whose light curves show eclipse features. Four of these 12 EBs are previously known. Supplementing our light curves with follow-up optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we establish two of the candidates as likely field EBs lying behind the ONC. We confirm the remaining six candidate systems, however, as newly identified ONC PMS EBs. These systems increase the number of known PMS EBs by over 50% and include the highest mass (theta1 Ori E, for which we provide a complete set of well-determined parameters including component masses of 2.807 and 2.797 M &sun;) and longest-period (ISOY J053505.71-052354.1, P ~ 20 days) PMS EBs currently known. In two cases (theta1 Ori E and ISOY J053526.88-044730.7), enough photometric and spectroscopic data exist to attempt an orbit solution and derive the system parameters. For the remaining systems, we combine our data with literature information to provide a preliminary characterization sufficient to guide follow-up investigations of these rare, benchmark systems.},

	Abstract = {We report extensive new photometry and spectroscopy of the highly variable young stellar object PTF 10nvg (also known as IRAS 20496+4354 and V2492 Cyg), including optical and near-infrared time-series data as well as mid-infrared and millimeter data. Following the previously reported 2010 rise to R PTF lsim13.ͫ5 and subsequent fade, during 2011 and 2012 the source underwent additional episodes of brightening, followed by several magnitude dimming events including prolonged faint states at R PTF >~ 20m. The observed high-amplitude variations are largely consistent with extinction changes (DeltaAV up to 30 mag) having a ~220 day quasi-periodic signal. However, photometry measured when the source was near maximum brightness in mid-2010 as well as in late-2012 does not phase well to this period. Spectral evolution includes not only changes in the spectral slope but also correlated variation in the prominence of TiO/VO/CO bands and atomic line emission, as well as anti-correlated variation in forbidden line emission which, along with H2, dominates optical and infrared spectra at faint epochs. Notably, night-to-night variations in several forbidden doublet strengths and ratios are observed. High-dispersion spectra were obtained in a variety of photometric states and reveal time-variable line profiles. Neutral and singly ionized atomic species are likely formed in an accretion flow and/or impact while the origin of zero-velocity atomic Li I lambda6707 in emission is unknown. Forbidden lines, including several rare species, exhibit blueshifted emission profiles and likely arise from an outflow/jet. Several of these lines are also seen spatially offset from the continuum source position, presumably in a shocked region of an extended jet. Blueshifted absorption components of the Na I D doublet, K I lambdalambda7665, 7669 doublet, and the O I 7774 triplet, as well as blueshifted absorption components seen against the broad Halpha and Ca II triplet emission lines, similarly are formed in the outflow. CARMA maps resolve on larger scales a spatially extended outflow in millimeter-wavelength CO. We attribute the recently observed photometric and spectroscopic behavior to rotating circumstellar disk material located at separation a ≈ 0.7(M */M &sun;)1/3 AU from the continuum source, causing the semi-periodic dimming. Occultation of the central star as well as the bright inner disk and the accretion/outflow zones renders shocked gas in the inner part of the jet amenable to observation at the faint epochs. We discuss PTF 10nvg as a source exhibiting both accretion-driven (perhaps analogous to V1647 Ori) and extinction-driven (perhaps analogous to UX Ori or GM Cep) high-amplitude variability phenomena.},

	Abstract = {We report new spectral types or spectral classification constraints for over 600 stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on medium resolution (R ≈ 1500-2000) red optical spectra acquired using the Palomar 200'' and Kitt Peak 3.5 m telescopes. Spectral types were initially estimated for F, G, and early K stars from atomic line indices while for late K and M stars, which constitute the majority of our sample, indices involving TiO and VO bands were used. To ensure proper classification, particularly for reddened, veiled, or nebula-contaminated stars, all spectra were then visually examined for type verification or refinement. We provide an updated spectral type table that supersedes previous work, increasing the percentage of optically visible ONC stars with spectral type information from 68% to 90%. However, for many objects, repeated observations have failed to yield spectral types primarily due to the challenges of adequate sky subtraction against a bright and spatially variable nebular background. The scatter between our new and our previously determined spectral types is approximately two spectral sub-classes. We also compare our grating spectroscopy results with classification based on narrow-band TiO filter photometry, finding similar scatter. While the challenges of working in the ONC may explain much of the spread, we highlight several stars showing significant and unexplained bona fide spectral variations in observations taken several years apart; these and similar cases could be due to a combination of accretion and extinction changes. Finally, nearly 20% of ONC stars exhibit obvious Ca II triplet emission indicative of strong accretion.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved near-IR spectroscopic observations of 15 young stars. Using a grism spectrometer behind the Keck interferometer, we obtained an angular resolution of a few milliarcseconds and a spectral resolution of 230, enabling probes of both gas and dust in the inner disks surrounding the target stars. We find that the angular size of the near-IR emission typically increases with wavelength, indicating hot, presumably gaseous material within the dust sublimation radius. Our data also clearly indicate Brgamma emission arising from hot hydrogen gas, and suggest the presence of water vapor and carbon monoxide gas in the inner disks of several objects. This gaseous emission is more compact than the dust continuum emission in all cases. We construct simple physical models of the inner disk and fit them to our data to constrain the spatial distribution and temperature of dust and gas emission components.},

	Abstract = {We present mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations from Gemini/TReCS that spatially resolve the dust emission around SR 21. The protoplanetary disk around SR 21 is believed to have a cleared gap extending from stellocentric radii of ~0.5 AU to ~20 AU, based on modeling of the observed spectral energy distribution (SED). Our new observations resolve the dust emission, and our data are inconsistent with the previous model. We require the disk to be completely cleared within ~10 AU, without the hot inner disk spanning ~0.25-0.5 AU posited previously. To fit the SED and mid-IR imaging data together, we propose a disk model with a large inner hole, but with a warm companion---possibly surrounded by circumstellar material of its own---residing near the outer edge of the cleared region. We also discuss a model with a narrow ring included in a large cleared inner disk region, and argue that it is difficult to reconcile with the data.},

	Abstract = {We study the hydrostatic density structure of the inner disc rim around Herbig Ae stars using the thermo-chemical hydrostatic code PRODIMO. We compare the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images from our hydrostatic disc models to that from prescribed density structure discs. The 2D continuum radiative transfer in PRODIMO includes isotropic scattering. The dust temperature is set by the condition of radiative equilibrium. In the thermal-decoupled case, the gas temperature is governed by the balance between various heating and cooling processes. The gas and dust interact thermally via photoelectrons, radiatively, and via gas accommodation on grain surfaces. As a result, the gas is much hotter than in the thermo-coupled case, where the gas and dust temperatures are equal, reaching a few thousands K in the upper disc layers and making the inner rim higher. A physically motivated density drop at the inner radius (`soft-edge') results in rounded inner rims, which appear ring-like in near-infrared images. The combination of lower gravity pull and hot gas beyond ˜1 au results in a disc atmosphere that reaches a height over radius ratio z/r of 0.2, while this ratio is 0.1 only in the thermo-coupled case. This puffed-up disc atmosphere intercepts larger amount of stellar radiation, which translates into enhanced continuum emission in the 3-30 mum wavelength region from hotter grains at ˜500 K. We also consider the effect of disc mass and grain size distribution on the SEDs self-consistently feeding those quantities back into the gas temperature, chemistry and hydrostatic equilibrium computation.},

	Abstract = {We study the structure of passively heated disks around T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars, and present a vectorized Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer model of protoplanetary disks. The vectorization provides a speed up factor of ~100 when compared to a scalar version of the code. Disks are composed of either fluffy carbon and silicate grains of various sizes or dust of the diffuse ISM. The IR emission and the midplane temperature derived by the MC method differ from models where the radiative transfer is solved in slab geometry of small ring segments. In the MC treatment, dusty halos above the disks are considered. Halos lead to an enhanced IR emission and warmer midplane temperature than do pure disks. Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium we find that the disk in the inner rim puffs up, followed by a shadowed region. The shadow reduces the temperature of the midplane and decreases the height of the extinction layer of the disk. It can be seen as a gap in the disk unless the surface is again exposed to direct stellar radiation. There the disk puffs up a second time, a third time, and so forth. Therefore several gaps and ring-like structures are present in the disk surface and appear in emission images. They result from shadows in the disks and are present without the need to postulate the existence of any companion or planet. As compared to Herbig Ae stars, such gaps and ring-like structures are more pronounced in regions of terrestrial planets around T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We present a deep XMM-Newton observation of DN Tau, a young M0-type accreting CTTS and investigate its X-ray properties and X-ray generating mechanisms. Specifically we examine the presence of X-ray emission from magnetic activity and accretion shocks and compare our new X-ray data with UV data taken simultaneously and with X-ray/UV observations performed before. We find that the X-ray emission from DN Tau is dominated by coronal plasma generated via magnetic activity, but also clearly detect a contribution of the accretion shocks to the cool plasma component at about 2 MK as consistently inferred from density and temperature analysis. Typical phenomena of active coronae like flaring, the presence of very hot plasma at 30 MK and an abundance pattern showing the inverse FIP effect are seen on DN Tau. Strong variations in the emission measure of the cooler plasma components between the 2005 and 2010 XMM data point to accretion related changes. The UV light curve taken simultaneously is in general not related to the X-ray brightness, but exhibits clear counterparts during the observed X-ray flares. The X-ray properties of DN Tau are similar to those of more massive CTTS, but its low mass and large radius shift the accretion shocks to lower temperatures, reducing their imprint in the X-ray regime.},

	Abstract = {A model for massive stars is constructed by piecing together evolutionary algorithms for the protostellar structure, the environment, the inflow and the radiation feedback. We investigate specified accretion histories of constant, decelerating and accelerating forms and consider both hot and cold accretion, identified with spherical free-fall and disk accretion, respectively. Diagnostic tools for the interpretation of the phases of massive star formation and testing the evolutionary models are then developed. Evolutionary tracks able to fit Herschel Space Telescope data require the generated stars to be three to four times less massive than in previous interpretations, thus being consistent with clump star formation efficiencies of $10 -- 15\%$. However, for these cold Hershel clumps, the bolometric temperature is not a good diagnostic to differentiate between accretion models. We also find that neither spherical nor disk accretion can explain the high radio luminosities of many protostars. Nevertheless, we discover a solution in which the extreme ultraviolet flux needed to explain the radio emission is produced if the accretion flow is via free-fall on to hot spots covering less than $10\%$ of the surface area. Moreover, the protostar must be compact, and so has formed through cold accretion. We show that these conclusions are independent of the imposed accretion history. This suggests that massive stars form via gas accretion through disks which, in the phase before the star bloats, download their mass via magnetic flux tubes on to the protostar.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of X-ray source contents of eight young open clusters with ages between 4 to 46 Myr using archival X-ray data from XMM-Newton. The probable cluster memberships of the X-ray sources have been established on the basis of multi-wavelength archival data, and samples of 152 pre-main sequence (PMS) low mass (< 2 M_\odot), 36 intermediate mass (2 - 10 M_\odot) and 16 massive (> 10 M_\odot) stars have been generated. X-ray spectral analyses of high mass stars reveal the presence of high temperature plasma with temperature <2 keV, and mean L_X/L_{bol} of 10^{-6.9}. In the case of PMS low mass stars, the plasma temperatures have been found to be in the range of 0.2 keV to 3 keV with a median value of ~1.3 keV, with no significant difference in plasma temperatures during their evolution from 4 to 46 Myr. The X-ray luminosity distributions of the PMS low mass stars have been found to be similar in the young star clusters under study. This may suggest a nearly uniform X-ray activity in the PMS low mass stars of ages ~4--14 Myr. These observed values of L_X/L_{bol} are found to have a mean value of 10^{-3.6\pm0.4}, which is below the X-ray saturation level.The L_X/L_{bol} values for the PMS low mass stars are well correlated with their bolometric luminosities, that implies its dependence on the internal structure of the low mass stars. The difference between the X-ray luminosity distributions of the intermediate mass stars and the PMS low mass stars has not been found to be statistically significant. Their L_X/L_{bol} values, however have been found to be significantly different from each other with a confidence level greater than 99.999%. The possibility of X-ray emission from the intermediate mass stars due to a low mass star in close proximity of the intermediate mass star can not be ruled out due to the limited spatial resolution of XMM-Newton.},

@article{goo99,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses the physical principles underpinning a new jet-launching mechanism described in a companion paper. In this new jet formation model, magnetic loops that connect the star to the disk become twisted and expand via helicity injection. This expansion drives an outflow, with the axial symmetry of the disk leading to a concentration of outflowing plasma along the rotation axis, forming the jet. In the companion paper, it is found that the radial location of the inner edge of the disk undergoes oscillations. In this paper, the physical causes of the disk oscillations are investigated. This investigation leads to the conclusion that there are three classes of flows that can arise, depending on the role of diffusive instabilities. The most diffusive flows allow the stellar magnetic field to slip through the accretion disk and yield steady accretion flows. Such configurations are unlikely to produce outflows. The flows with intermediate diffusivity have been described by Lovelace, Romanova, & Bisnovatyi-Kogan and represent conditions in which the field is effectively frozen into the accretion disk azimuthally but slips radially. In the absence of magnetic reconnection, such configurations are predicted to produce steady flows with logarithmically collimated disk winds. The least diffusive flows, in which the bulk radial disk velocities are greater at times than the speeds with which magnetic field lines can diffuse into the disks, lead to the formation of the collimated unsteady jets described in the companion paper and are the primary interest of this paper. The jet velocity is also addressed.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the intrinsic colors and temperatures of 5-30 Myr old pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) stars using the F0- through M9-type members of nearby, negligibly reddened groups: the eta Cha cluster, the TW Hydra Association, the beta Pic Moving Group, and the Tucana-Horologium Association. To check the consistency of spectral types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra taken with the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope. Combining these new types with published spectral types and photometry from the literature (Johnson-Cousins BVIC , 2MASS JHKS and WISE W1, W2, W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral type-color sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars. Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective temperatures (T eff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new T eff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf star scales. While our new T eff scale for pre-MS stars is within sime100 K of dwarfs at a given spectral type for stars <G5, for G5 through K6, the pre-MS stars are ~250 K cooler than their MS counterparts. Lastly, we present (1) a modern T eff, optical/IR color, and BC sequence for O9V-M9V MS stars based on an extensive literature survey, (2) a revised Q-method relation for dereddening UBV photometry of OB-type stars, and (3) introduce two candidate spectral standard stars as representatives of spectral types K8V and K9V.},

	Abstract = {We report on synoptic observations at 3.6 and 4.5 mum of young stellar objects in IC 348 with 38 epochs covering 40 days. We find that among the detected cluster members, 338 at [3.6] and 269 at both [3.6] and [4.5], many are variable on daily to weekly timescales with typical fluctuations of ~0.1 mag. The fraction of variables ranges from 20% for the diskless pre-main sequence stars to 60% for the stars still surrounded by infalling envelopes. We also find that stars in the exposed cluster core are less variable than the stars in the dense, slightly younger, southwestern ridge. This trend persists even after accounting for the underlying correlation with infrared spectral energy distribution type, suggesting that the change in variable fraction is not simply a reflection of the change in relative fraction of class I versus class II sources across the cloud, but instead reflects a change in variability with age. We also see a strong correlation between infrared variability and X-ray luminosity among the class II sources. The observed variability most likely reflects large changes in the structure of the inner wall located at the dust sublimation radius. We explore the possibility that these structural perturbations could be caused by a hot spot on the star heating dust above the sublimation temperature, causing it to evaporate rapidly, and increasing the inner radius for a portion of the disk. Under a number of simplifying assumptions we show that this model can reproduce the size and timescale of the 3.6 and 4.5 mum fluctuations. Regardless of its source, the infrared variability indicates that the inner disk is not a slowly evolving entity, but instead is a bubbling, warped, dented mass of gas and dust whose global size and shape fluctuate in a matter of days.},

	Abstract = {We present new Chandra X-ray data of the NGC 1333 embedded cluster and combine these data with existing Chandra data, Spitzer photometry, and ground-based spectroscopy of both the NGC 1333 and Serpens cloud core clusters to perform a detailed study of the X-ray properties of two of the nearest embedded clusters to the Sun. We first present new, deeper observations of NGC 1333 with Chandra ACIS-I and combine these with existing Spitzer observations of the region. In NGC 1333, a total of 95 cluster members are detected in X-rays of which 54 were previously identified in the Spitzer data. Of the Spitzer-identified sources, we detected 23% of the Class I protostars, 53% of the flat-spectrum sources, 52% of the Class II, and 50% of the transition disk young stellar objects (YSOs). Forty-one Class III members of the cluster are identified, bringing the total identified YSO population to 178. The X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of the NGC 1333 and Serpens clusters are compared to each other and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Based on a comparison of the XLFs of the Serpens and NGC 1333 clusters to the previously published ONC, we obtain a new distance for the Serpens cluster of 360+22 -13 pc. Using our previously published spectral types, effective temperatures, and bolometric luminosities, we analyze the dependence of the X-ray emission on the measured stellar properties. The X-ray luminosity was found to depend on the calculated bolometric luminosity as in previous studies of other clusters. We examine the dependence of LX on stellar surface area and effective temperature, and find that LX depends primarily on the stellar surface area. In the NGC 1333 cluster, the Class III sources have a somewhat higher X-ray luminosity for a given surface area. We also find evidence in NGC 1333 for a jump in the X-ray luminosity between spectral types of M0 and K7, we speculate that this may result from the presence of radiative zones in the K-stars. The gas column density versus extinction in the NGC 1333 parental molecular cloud was examined using the hydrogen column density determined from the X-ray absorption to the embedded stars and the K-band extinction measured to those stars. In NGC 1333, we find NH = 0.89 $\pm$ 0.13 × 1022 AK , this is lower than expected of the standard interstellar medium but similar to that found previously in the Serpens cloud core.},

	Abstract = {Context. The physical origin of the strong magnetic activity in T Tauri stars and its relation to stellar rotation is not yet well-understood.  Aims: We investigate the relation between the X-ray activity, rotation, and Rossby number for a sample of young stars in the ≈3 Myr old cluster IC 348.  Methods: We use the data of four Chandra observations of IC 348 to derive the X-ray luminosities of the young stars. Basic stellar parameters and rotation rates are collected from the literature. This results in a sample of 82 X-ray detected stars with known rotation periods. We determine the Rossby numbers (i.e. the ratio of rotation period to convective turnover time) of 76 of these stars from stellar structure- and evolution-models for pre-main sequence stars.  Results: The young stars in IC 348 show no correlation between X-ray activity and rotation period. For the Rossby numbers, nearly all IC 348 stars are in the saturated regime of the activity-rotation relation defined by main-sequence stars. Searching for possible super-saturation effects, we find a marginal (but statistically in-significant) trend that the stars with the smallest Rossby numbers have slightly lower X-ray activity levels. There are no significant differences in the X-ray activity level for stars of different spectral types and no relation between spectral type and Rossby number is seen. In addition, for stars belonging to different IR-classes, no significant differences are present for the X-ray activity level as well as for their Rossby numbers. We compare the dispersion in the fractional X-ray luminosities of the stars in the saturated rotation regime in IC 348 to that seen in younger and older stellar populations. The scatter seen in the ≈ 3 Myr old IC 348 [sigma(log (LX/Lbol)) = 0.43] is considerably smaller than for the ≈ 1 Myr old Orion nebula cluster [sigma(log (LX/Lbol)) = 0.63], but, at the same time, considerably larger than the dispersion seen in the ≈ 30 Myr old cluster NGC 2547 [sigma(log (LX/Lbol)) = 0.24] and in main-sequence stars.  Conclusions: The results of our X-ray analysis of IC 348 show that neither the rotation rates nor the presence/absence of circumstellar disks are of fundamental importance for determining the level of X-ray activity in TTS. Our results suggest that the scatter in the X-ray activity levels for the rapidly rotating members of young clusters decreases with the age of the stellar population. We interpret this as a signature of the changing interior structure of pre-main sequence stars and the consequent changes in the dynamo mechanisms that are responsible for the magnetic field generation.},

@article{pas13,
	Abstract = {There is growing observational evidence that disk evolution is stellar-mass dependent. Here, we show that these dependencies extend to the atomic and molecular content of disk atmospheres. We analyze a unique dataset of high-resolution Spitzer/IRS spectra from 8 very low-mass star and brown dwarf disks. We report the first detections of Ne+, H2, CO2, and tentative detections of H2O toward these faint and low-mass disks. Two of our [NeII] 12.81 micron emission lines likely trace the hot (>5,000 K) disk surface irradiated by X-ray photons from the central stellar/sub-stellar object. The H2 S(2) and S(1) fluxes are consistent with arising below the fully or partially ionized surface traced by the [NeII] emission, in gas at about 600 K. We confirm the higher C2H2/HCN flux and column density ratio in brown dwarf disks previously noted from low-resolution IRS spectra. Our high-resolution spectra also show that the HCN/H2O fluxes of brown dwarf disks are on average higher than those of T Tauri disks. Our LTE modeling hints that this difference extends to column density ratios if H2O lines trace warm > 600 K disk gas. These trends suggest that the inner regions of brown dwarf disks have a lower O/C ratio than those of T Tauri disks which may result from a more efficient formation of non-migrating icy planetesimals. A O/C=1, as inferred from our analysis, would have profound implications on the bulk composition of rocky planets that can form around very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

@article{ban13,
	Abstract = {Young stars are known to show variability due to non-steady mass accretion rate from their circumstellar disks. Accretion flares can produce strong energetic irradiation and heating that may affect the disk in the planet formation region, close to the central star. During an extreme accretion outburst in the young star EX Lupi, the prototype of EXor variables, remarkable changes in molecular gas emission from $\sim1$ AU in the disk have recently been observed (Banzatti et al. 2012). Here, we focus on water vapor and explore how it is affected by variable accretion luminosity in T Tauri stars. We monitored a young highly variable solar-mass star, DR Tau, using simultaneously two high/medium-resolution ESO-VLT spectrographs: VISIR at 12.4 $\mu$m to observe water lines from the disk, and X-shooter covering from 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m to constrain the stellar accretion. Three epochs spanning timescales from several days to several weeks were obtained. Accretion luminosity was estimated to change within a factor $\sim2$, and no change in water emission was detected at a significant level. In comparison to EX Lupi and EXor outbursts, DR Tau suggests that the less long-lived and weaker variability phenomena typical of T Tauri stars may leave water at planet-forming radii in the disk mostly unaffected. We propose that these systems may provide evidence for two processes that act over different timescales: UV photochemistry in the disk atmosphere (faster) and heating of the disk deeper layers (slower).},

	Abstract = {We present new results on the classical T Tauri star RU Lupi based on three observing runs collecting high-resolution spectra, complementary NIR spectra, multicolour photometric data, and X-ray observations. The photospheric absorption lines are weakened. This veiling becomes extremely strong on occasion, and we show that this effect is due to narrow emission lines that fill in the photospheric lines. The blue-shifted wings in the optical emission lines of He I, attributed to a stellar wind, are remarkably stable in equivalent width. In contrast, the red-shifted wings change dramatically in strength depending on rotational phase. From the pattern of variability we infer that these wings originate in accreting gas close to the star, and that the accretion funnels are bent and trail the hot spot. Forbidden emission lines are very stable over the entire observing period and originate in the disk wind. A system of narrow blue-shifted absorption features seen in lines of Ca II and Na I can be traced to a disk wind as well. Slightly blue-shifted emission components are present in the forbidden lines and might be related to a wide angle molecular disk wind.},

	Abstract = {We seek to establish the presence and properties of gas in the circumstellar disk orbiting T Cha, a nearby (d~110 pc), relatively evolved (age ~5-7 Myr) yet actively accreting 1.5 Msun T Tauri star. We used the APEX 12 m radiotelescope to search for submillimeter molecular emission from the T Cha disk, and we reanalyzed archival XMM-Newton spectroscopy of T Cha to ascertain the intervening absorption due to disk gas along the line of sight to the star (N_H). We detected submillimeter rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO, HCN, CN and HCO+ from the T Cha disk. The 12CO line appears to display a double-peaked line profile indicative of Keplerian rotation. Analysis of the CO emission line data indicates that the disk around T Cha has a mass (M_disk,H_2 = 80 M_earth) similar to, but more compact (R_disk, CO~80 AU) than, other nearby, evolved molecular disks (e.g. V4046 Sgr, TW Hya, MP Mus) in which cold molecular gas has been previously detected. The HCO+/13CO and HCN/13CO, line ratios measured for T Cha appear similar to those of other evolved circumstellar disks (i.e. TW Hya and V4046 Sgr), while the CN/13CO ratio appears somewhat weaker. Analysis of the XMM-Newton data shows that the atomic absorption $N_H$ toward T Cha is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than toward the other nearby T Tauri with evolved disks. Furthermore, the ratio between atomic absorption and optical extinction N_H/A_V toward T Cha is higher than the typical value observed for the interstellar medium and young stellar objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster. This may suggest that the fraction of metals in the disk gas is higher than in the interstellar medium. Our results confirm that pre-main sequence stars older than ~5 Myr, when accreting, retain cold molecular disks, and that those relatively evolved disks display similar physical and chemical properties.},

	Abstract = {The magnetic fields of young stars set their coronal properties and control their spin evolution via the star-disc interaction and outflows. Using 14 magnetic maps of 10 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) we investigate their closed X-ray emitting coronae, their open wind-bearing magnetic fields, and the geometry of magnetospheric accretion flows. The magnetic fields of all the CTTSs are multipolar. Stars with simpler (more dipolar) large-scale magnetic fields have stronger fields, are slower rotators, and have larger X-ray emitting coronae compared to stars with more complex large-scale magnetic fields. The field complexity controls the distribution of open and closed field regions across the stellar surface, and strongly influences the location and shapes of accretion hot spots. However, the higher order field components are of secondary importance in determining the total unsigned open magnetic flux, which depends mainly on the strength of the dipole component and the stellar surface area. Likewise, the dipole component alone provides an adequate approximation of the disc truncation radius. For some stars, the pressure of the hot coronal plasma dominates the stellar magnetic pressure and forces open the closed field inside the disc truncation radius. This is significant as accretion models generally assume that the magnetic field has a closed geometry out to the inner disc edge.},

	Abstract = {We present X-Shooter/VLT observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-mass stellar and sub-stellar objects (YSOs) in the Lupus star forming region, spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2Msun, but mostly with 0.1Msun < Mstar < 0.5Msun. Our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship between excess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to investigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the central object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and from it the accretion rate (Macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the UV to the near-IR, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. The flux and luminosity (Ll) of a large number of emission lines of H, He, CaII, etc., observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. The luminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical relationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have a lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. Our measurements extend the Pab and Brg relationships to Lacc values about two orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm that different methodologies to measure Lacc and Macc yield significantly different results: Ha line profile modelling may underestimate Macc by 0.6 to 0.8dex with respect to Macc derived from continuum-excess measures. Such differences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between Macc and other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derive Macc in the range 2e-12 -- 4e-8 Msun/yr and conclude that Macc is proportional to Mstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in previous studies. A number of properties indicate that the physical conditions of the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in Macc.},

@article{bat13a,
	Abstract = {The presence of giant gaseous planets that reside in close proximity to their host stars may be a consequence of large-scale radial migration through the proto-planetary nebulae. Within the context of this picture, significant orbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets can be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment with the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital obliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star interactions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit misalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum transfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational evolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and accretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote particular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that while generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is largely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e. specific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface fields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of magnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of disk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk properties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in systems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show that the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an encounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the disk-torquing frequency. Cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up a previously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and its consequences in a unified manner.},

	Abstract = {We have performed smoothed particle radiation magnetohydrodynamics (SPRMHD) simulations of the collapse of rotating, magnetised molecular cloud cores to form protostars. The calculations follow the formation and evolution of the first hydrostatic core, the collapse to form a stellar core, the launching of outflows from both the first hydrostatic core and stellar cores, and the breakout of the stellar outflow from the remnant of the first core. We investigate the roles of magnetic fields and thermal feedback on the outflow launching process, finding that both magnetic and thermal forces contribute to the launching of the stellar outflow. We also follow the stellar cores until they grow to masses of up to 20 Jupiter-masses, and determine their properties. We find that at this early stage, before fusion begins, the stellar cores have radii of $\approx 3$ R$_\odot$ with radial entropy profiles that increase outward (i.e. are convectively stable) and minimum entropies per baryon of $s/k_{\rm B} \approx 14$ in their interiors. The structure of the stellar cores is found to be insensitive to variations in the initial magnetic field strength. With reasonably strong initial magnetic fields, accretion on to the stellar cores occurs through inspiralling magnetised pseudo-discs with negligible radiative losses, as opposed to first cores which effectively radiate away the energy liberated in the accretion shocks at their surfaces. We find that magnetic field strengths of >10 kG can be implanted in stellar cores at birth.},

	Abstract = {Molecular clouds are supersonically turbulent. This turbulence governs the initial mass function and the star formation rate. In order to understand the details of star formation, it is therefore essential to understand the properties of turbulence, in particular the probability distribution of density in turbulent clouds. We present formaldehyde volume density measurements of a non-star-forming cloud along the line of sight towards W49A. We use these measurements in conjunction with total mass estimates from 13CO to infer the shape of the density probability distribution function. This method is complementary to measurements of turbulence via the column density distribution and should be applicable to any molecular cloud with detected CO. We show that turbulence in this cloud is probably compressively driven, with a compressive-to-total Mach number ratio $b = \mathcal{M}_C/\mathcal{M}>0.4$. We measure the standard deviation of the density distribution, constraining it to the range $1.5 < \sigma_s < 1.9$ assuming that the density is lognormally distributed. This measurement represents an essential input into star formation laws. The method of averaging over different excitation conditions to produce a model of emission from a turbulent cloud is generally applicable to optically thin line observations.},

	Abstract = {We present sensitive, sub-arcsecond resolution Submillimeter Array observations of the protoplanetary disk around the nearby, pre-main sequence spectroscopic binary V4046 Sgr. We report for the first time a large inner hole (r = 29 AU) spatially resolved in the 1.3 mm continuum emission and study the structure of this disk using radiative transfer calculations to model the spectral energy distribution, continuum visibilities, and spectral line emission of CO and its main isotopologues. Our modeling scheme demonstrates that the majority of the dust mass is distributed in a narrow ring (centered at 37 AU with a FWHM of 16 AU) that is ~5× more compact than the gas disk. This structure implies that the dust-to-gas mass ratio has a strong spatial variation, ranging from a value much larger than typical of the interstellar medium (ISM) at the ring to much smaller than that of the ISM at larger disk radii. We suggest that these basic structural features are potentially observational signatures of the accumulation of solids at a local gas pressure maximum. These models also require a substantial population of ~mum sized grains inside the central disk cavity. We suggest that this structure is likely the result of dynamical interactions with a low-mass companion, although photoevaporation may also play a secondary role.},

	Abstract = {This paper is dedicated to investigating the kinematic properties of the Lupus moving group of young stars with the primary objective of deriving individual parallaxes for each group member. We identify those stars in the Lupus star-forming region that define the comoving association of young stars by utilizing our new and improved convergent point search method that allows us to derive the precise position of the convergent point of the comoving association from the stars' proper motions. We used published proper motion catalogs and searched the literature for radial velocities, which are needed to compute individual parallaxes. We supplemented the radial velocity data with new measurements from spectroscopic observations performed with the FEROS spectrograph mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla. We identify a comoving group with 109 pre-main sequence stars and candidates that define the kinematic properties of the Lupus low-mass star-forming region. We derive individual parallaxes for stars with known radial velocity and tentative parallaxes for the remaining group members by assuming that all stars share the same space motion. The convergent point method, combined with the k-NN algorithm, makes it possible to distinguish the Lupus and Upper Centaurus Lupus stars from the adjacent Scorpius-Centaurus association. We find significant depth effects in this region and show that the classical T Tauri stars, located in the close vicinity of the Lupus molecular clouds, form a background population, while the weak-emission line T Tauri stars are dispersed not only in angular extent but also in depth. The newly derived individual parallaxes will be used in a forthcoming paper to refine the masses and ages of Lupus T Tauri stars, with the aim of better constraining the lifetimes of their circumstellar, protoplanetary disks.},

@article{lad13,
	Abstract = {We investigate Schmidt's conjecture (i.e., that the star formation rate scales in a power-law fashion with the gas density) for four well-studied local molecular clouds (GMCs). Using the Bayesian methodology we show that a local Schmidt scaling relation of the form Sigma*(A_K) = kappa x (A_K)^{beta} (protostars pc^{-2}) exists within (but not between) GMCs. Further we find that the Schmidt scaling law, by itself, does not provide an adequate description of star formation activity in GMCs. Because the total number of protostars produced by a cloud is given by the product of Sigma*(A_K) and S'(> A_K), the differential surface area distribution function, integrated over the entire cloud, the cloud's structure plays a fundamental role in setting the level of its star formation activity. For clouds with similar functional forms of Sigma*(A_K), observed differences in their total SFRs are primarily due to the differences in S'(> A_K) between the clouds. The coupling of Sigma*(A_K) with the measured S'(> A_K) in these clouds also produces a steep jump in the SFR and protostellar production above A_K ~ 0.8 magnitudes. Finally, we show that there is no global Schmidt law that relates the star formation rate and gas mass surface densities between GMCs. Consequently, the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt scaling relation for disk galaxies is likely an artifact of unresolved measurements of GMCs and not a result of any underlying physical law of star formation characterizing the molecular gas.},

	Abstract = {We report orbital parameters for two low-mass, pre-main sequence, double-lined spectroscopic binaries VSB 111 and VSB 126. These systems were originally identified as single-lined on the basis of visible-light observations. We obtained high-resolution, infrared spectra with the 10-m Keck II telescope, detected absorption lines of the secondary stars, and measured radial velocities of both components in the systems. The visible light spectra were obtained on the 1.5-m Wyeth reflector at the Oak Ridge Observatory, the 1.5-m Tillinghast reflector at the F. L. Whipple Observatory, and the 4.5-m equivalent Multiple Mirror Telescope. The combination of our visible and infrared observations of VSB 111 leads to a period of 902.1+/-0.9 days, an eccentricity of 0.788+/-0.008, and a mass ratio of 0.52+/-0.05. VSB 126 has a period of 12.9244+/-0.0002 days, an eccentricity of 0.18+/-0.02, and a mass ratio of 0.29+/-0.02. Visible-light photometry, using the 0.8-m telescope at Lowell Observatory, provided rotation periods for the primary stars in both systems, 3.74+/-0.02 days for VSB 111 and 5.71+/-0.07 days for VSB 126. Both binaries are located in the young, active star-forming cluster NGC 2264 at a distance of ~800 pc. The difference in the center-of-mass velocities of the two systems is consistent with the radial velocity gradient seen across NGC 2264. To test the evolutionary models for accuracy and consistency, we compare the stellar properties derived from several sets of theoretical calculations for pre-main sequence evolution with our dynamical results.},

	Abstract = {The formation of stars in massive clusters is one of the main modes of the star formation process. However, the study of massive star-forming regions is hampered by their typically large distances to the Sun. One exception to this is the massive star-forming region Cygnus OB2 in the Cygnus X region, at the distance of ~1400 pc. Cygnus OB2 hosts very rich populations of massive and low-mass stars, being the best target in our Galaxy to study the formation of stars, circumstellar disks, and planets in the presence of massive stars. In this paper, we combine a wide and deep set of photometric data, from the r band to 24 mum, in order to select the disk-bearing population of stars in Cygnus OB2 and identify the class I, class II, and stars with transition and pre-transition disks. We selected 1843 sources with infrared excesses in an area of 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$ centered on Cyg OB2 in several evolutionary stages: 8.4% class I, 13.1% flat-spectrum sources, 72.9% class II, 2.3% pre-transition disks, and 3.3% transition disks. The spatial distribution of these sources shows a central cluster surrounded by an annular overdensity and some clumps of recent star formation in the outer region. Several candidate subclusters are identified, both along the overdensity and in the rest of the association.},

	Abstract = {At the distance of 99-116 pc, HD141569A is one of the nearest HerbigAe stars that is surrounded by a tenuous disk, probably in transition between a massive primordial disk and a debris disk. We observed the fine-structure lines of OI at 63 and 145 micron and the CII line at 157 micron with the PACS instrument onboard the Herschel Space Telescope as part of the open-time large programme GASPS. We complemented the atomic line observations with archival Spitzer spectroscopic and photometric continuum data, a ground-based VLT-VISIR image at 8.6 micron, and 12CO fundamental ro-vibrational and pure rotational J=3-2 observations. We simultaneously modeled the continuum emission and the line fluxes with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo to derive the disk gas- and dust properties assuming no dust settling. The models suggest that the oxygen lines are emitted from the inner disk around HD141569A, whereas the [CII] line emission is more extended. The CO submillimeter flux is emitted mostly by the outer disk. Simultaneous modeling of the photometric and line data using a realistic disk structure suggests a dust mass derived from grains with a radius smaller than 1 mm of 2.1E-7 MSun and from grains with a radius of up to 1 cm of 4.9E-6 MSun. We constrained the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) mass to be between 2E-11 and 1..4E-10 MSun assuming circumcircumcoronene (C150H30) as the representative PAH. The associated PAH abundance relative to hydrogen is lower than those found in the interstellar medium (3E-7) by two to three orders of magnitude. The disk around HD141569A is less massive in gas (2.5 to 4.9E-4 MSun or 67 to 164 MEarth) and has a flat opening angle (<10%). [abridged]},

	Abstract = {Presented are the results of a near-IR photometric survey on 1678 stars in the direction of the \rho Ophiuchus (\rho Oph) star forming region using data from the 2MASS Calibration Database. For each target in this sample, up to 1584 individual J, H and K_s band photometric measurements with a cadence of ~1 day are obtained over 3 observing seasons spanning ~2.5 years; it is the most intensive survey of stars in this region to date. This survey identifies 101 variable stars with \Delta K_s band amplitudes from 0.044 to 2.31 mag and \Delta(J-K_s) color amplitudes ranging from 0.053 to 1.47 mag. Of the 72 young \rho Oph star cluster members included in this survey, 79% are variable; in addition, 22 variable stars are identified as candidate members. Based on the temporal behavior of the K_s time-series, the variability is distinguished as either periodic, long time-scale or irregular. This temporal behavior coupled with the behavior of stellar colors is used to assign a dominant variability mechanism. A new period-searching algorithm finds periodic signals in 32 variable stars with periods between 0.49 to 92 days.},

	Abstract = {(abridged) AIMS. We investigate the dynamics and stability of post-shock plasma streaming along nonuniform stellar magnetic fields at the impact region of accretion columns. We study how the magnetic field configuration and strength determine the structure, geometry, and location of the shock-heated plasma. METHODS. We model the impact of an accretion stream onto the chromosphere of a CTTS by 2D axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Our model takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling, and the magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction. RESULTS. The structure, stability, and location of the shocked plasma strongly depend on the configuration and strength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields, a large component of B may develop perpendicular to the stream at the base of the accretion column, limiting the sinking of the shocked plasma into the chromosphere. An envelope of dense and cold chromospheric material may also develop around the shocked column. For strong magnetic fields, the field configuration determines the position of the shock and its stand-off height. If the field is strongly tapered close to the chromosphere, an oblique shock may form well above the stellar surface. In general, a nonuniform magnetic field makes the distribution of emission measure vs. temperature of the shocked plasma lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field. CONCLUSIONS. The initial strength and configuration of the magnetic field in the impact region of the stream are expected to influence the chromospheric absorption and, therefore, the observability of the shock-heated plasma in the X-ray band. The field strength and configuration influence also the energy balance of the shocked plasma, its emission measure at T > 1 MK being lower than expected for a uniform field. The above effects contribute in underestimating the mass accretion rates derived in the X-ray band.},

	Abstract = {Diffuse interstellar bands are usually observed in spectra of hot stars, where interstellar lines are rarely blended with stellar ones. The need for hot stars is a strong limitation in the number of sightlines we can observe and the distribution of sightlines in the Galaxy, as hot stars are rare and concentrated in the Galactic plane. We are introducing a new method, where interstellar lines can be observed in spectra of cool stars in large spectroscopic surveys. The method is completely automated and does not require prior knowledge of the stellar parameters. If known, the stellar parameters only reduce the computational time and are not involved in the extraction of the interstellar spectrum. The main step in extracting interstellar lines is a construction of the stellar spectrum, which is in our method done by finding other observed spectra that lack interstellar features and are otherwise very similar to the spectrum in question. Such spectra are then combined into a single stellar spectrum template, which matches the stellar component in an observed spectrum. We demonstrate the performance of this new method on a sample of 482,430 spectra observed in RAVE survey. However, many spectra have to be combined (48 on average) in order to achieve a S/N ratio high enough to measure the DIB's profile, hence limiting the spatial information about the ISM. Only one strong interstellar line is included in the RAVE spectral range, a diffuse interstellar band at 8620 \AA. We compare its equivalent width with extinction maps and with Bayesian reddening, calculated for individual stars, and provide a linear relation between the equivalent width and reddening. Separately from the introduced method, we calculate equivalent widths of the diffuse interstellar band in spectra of hot stars with known extinction and compare all three linear relations with each other and with relations from the literature.},

	Abstract = {Protostellar jets appear at all stages of star formation when the accretion process is still at work. Jets travel at velocities of hundreds of km/s, creating strong shocks when interacting with interstellar medium. Several cases of jets have been detected in X-rays, typically showing soft emission. For the first time, we report evidence of hard X-ray emission possibly related to non-thermal processes not explained by previous models of the post-shock emission predicted in the jet/ambient interaction scenario. HH 80 is located at the south head of the jet associated to the massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048. It shows soft and hard X-ray emission in regions that are spatially separated, with the soft X-ray emission region situated behind the region of hard X-ray emission. We propose a scenario for HH 80 where soft X-ray emission is associated to thermal processes from the interaction of the jet with denser ambient matter and the hard X-ray emission is produced by synchrotron radiation at the front shock.},

	Abstract = {We have systematically studied the X-ray emission (both the quiescent component and the flares) of the dM3e star AD Leo, analyzing the existing observations from the Einstein IPC, ROSAT PSPC and ASCA SIS instruments. Using a consistent method which explicitly considers the possibility of sustained heating we have analyzed the six flares which have sufficient statistics, deriving constraints on the physical parameters of the flaring regions. In all cases the flaring loops are likely compact (L =~ 0.3 R_*), and confined to a rather narrow range of sizes, incompatible with the large (L >~ R_*) tenuous loops claimed by previous analyses of flares on AD Leo and other similar stars. The flaring loops appear to have a larger cross section (beta = r/L =~ 0.3) than customarily assumed (e.g. beta =~ 0.1). All flares show evidence of significant heating during the decay phase. Although the derived peak pressures are high (up to P =~ 104 dyne cm-2) with a peak temperature of =~ 50 MK, the magnetic fields required to confine such loops and to produce the observed flare luminosity are relatively modest (B =~ 1-2 kG) and fully compatible with the photospheric magnetic fields measured in several flare stars. If the narrow range of loop sizes obtained is extrapolated to the quiescent structures responsible for the active corona, the latter can be naturally scaled up from the solar case through a modest (a factor of 10) increase in pressure in otherwise solar-like active structures with a small surface filling factor ( =~ 5%). The quiescent component of the corona shows no evidence for abundance peculiarities with respect to the photosphere, and the quiescent coronal luminosity is remarkably constant (with variations of less than a factor of 2) across the almost 20 yr span of the observations discussed here.},

	Abstract = {We present an X-ray observation of the eclipsing binary Algol, obtained with the BeppoSAX observatory. During the observation a huge flare was observed, exceptional both in duration as well as in peak plasma temperature and total energy release. The wide spectral response of the different BeppoSAX instruments, together with the long decay time scale of the flare, allowed us to perform a detailed time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic analysis of the flare. We derive the physical parameters of the emitting region together with the plasma density applying different methods to the observed flare decay. The X-ray emission from the flare is totally eclipsed during the secondary optical eclipse, so that the size of the emitting region is strongly constrained (as described in a companion paper) on purely geometrical arguments. The size of the flare thus derived is much smaller than the size derived from the analysis of the evolution of the spectral parameters using the quasi-static cooling formalism, showing that the time evolution of the flare is determined essentially from the temporal profile of the heating, with the intrinsic decay of the flaring loop having little relevance. The analysis of the decay with the technique recently developed for solar flares by \cite*{rbp+97} on the other hand is in much better agreement with the eclipse-derived constraints. The very high signal-to-noise of the individual spectra strongly constrains some of the derived physical parameters. In particular, very significant evidence for a three-fold increase in coronal abundance and for a large increase in absorbing column density during the initial phases of the flare evolution is present.},

	Abstract = {To distinguish between the different theories proposed to explain massive star formation, it is crucial to establish the distribution, the extinction, and the density of low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. We analyzed deep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We found that pre-main sequence (PMS) low-mass stars cluster toward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium Cluster (TC), the Orion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC1-S. We derived low-mass stellar densities of 10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the TC and OMC1-S, and of 10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in the OHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive star cradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars. The X-ray observations show for the first time in the TC that low-mass stars with intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most massive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are needed in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of low-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high fragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a low-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion.},

	Abstract = {Aims: NGC 2264 is a young cluster with a rich circumstellar disk population which makes it an ideal target for studying the evolution of stellar clusters. Our goal is to study the star formation history of NGC 2264 and to analyse the primordial disk evolution of its members.  Methods: The study presented is based on data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, combined with deep near-infrared (NIR) ground-based FLAMINGOS imaging and previously published optical data.  Results: We build NIR dust extinction maps of the molecular cloud associated with the cluster, and determine it to have a mass of 2.1 × 103 M&sun; above an AV of 7 mag. Using a differential Ks-band luminosity function (KLF) of the cluster, we estimate the size of the population of NGC 2264, within the area observed by FLAMINGOS, to be 1436 $\pm$ 242 members. The star formation efficiency is >= ~25%. We identify the disk population and divide it into 3 groups based on their spectral energy distribution slopes from 3.6 mum to 8 mum and on the 24 mum excess emission: (i) optically thick inner disks, (ii) anaemic inner disks, and (iii) disks with inner holes, or transition disks. We analyse the spatial distribution of these sources and find that sources with thick disks segregate into sub-clusterings, whereas sources with anaemic disks do not. Furthermore, sources with anaemic disks are found to be unembedded (i.e., with AV < 3 mag), whereas the clustered sources with thick disks are still embedded within the parental cloud.  Conclusions: NGC 2264 has undergone more than one star-forming event, where the anaemic and extincted thick disk population appear to have formed in separate episodes: the sources with anaemic disks are more evolved and have had time to disperse and populate a halo of the cluster. We also find tentative evidence of triggered star-formation in the Fox Fur Nebula. In terms of disk evolution, our findings support the emerging disk evolution paradigm of two distinct evolutionary paths for primordial optically thick disks: a homologous one where the disk emission decreases uniformly at NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths, and a radially differential one where the emission from the inner region of the disk decreases more rapidly than from the outer region (forming transition disks).},

	Abstract = {Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) are variable in different time-scales. One type of variability is possibly connected with the accretion of matter through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that occurs at the interface between an accretion disc and a stellar magnetosphere. In this regime, matter accretes in several temporarily formed accretion streams or `tongues' which appear in random locations, and produce stochastic photometric and line variability. We use the results of global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of matter flows in both stable and unstable accretion regimes to calculate time-dependent hydrogen line profiles and study their variability behaviours. In the stable regime, some hydrogen lines (e.g. Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, Pabeta and Brgamma) show a redshifted absorption component only during a fraction of a stellar rotation period, and its occurrence is periodic. However, in the unstable regime, the redshifted absorption component is present rather persistently during a whole stellar rotation cycle, and its strength varies non-periodically. In the stable regime, an ordered accretion funnel stream passes across the line of sight to an observer only once per stellar rotation period while in the unstable regime, several accreting streams/tongues, which are formed randomly, pass across the line of sight to an observer. The latter results in the quasi-stationary appearance of the redshifted absorption despite the strongly unstable nature of the accretion. In the unstable regime, multiple hotspots form on the surface of the star, producing the stochastic light curve with several peaks per rotation period. This study suggests a CTTS that exhibits a stochastic light curve and a stochastic line variability, with a rather persistent redshifted absorption component, may be accreting in the unstable accretion regime.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays (CRs) are thought to provide an important source of ionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks; however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. As is observed in the solar system, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation of CRs within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into the disk. In this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of CR modulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study how these processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. We construct a two-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a T-Tauri star system, focusing on ionization from stellar and interstellar FUV, stellar X-ray photons, and CRs. We show that stellar winds can power a heliosphere-like analog, i.e., a "T-Tauriosphere," diminishing CR ionization rates by several orders of magnitude at low to moderate CR energies (E CR <= 1 GeV). We explore models of both the observed solar wind CR modulation and a highly simplified estimate for "elevated" CR modulation as would be expected from a young T-Tauri star. In the former (solar analog) case, we estimate the ionization rate from galactic CRs to be zetaCR ~ (0.23-1.4) × 10-18 s-1. This range of values, which we consider to be the maximum CR ionization rate for the disk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumed in current models for disk chemistry and physics. In the latter elevated case, i.e., for a "T-Tauriosphere," the ionization rate by CRs is zetaCR <~ 10-20 s-1, which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. We discuss the implications of a diminished CR ionization rate on the gas physics by estimating the size of the resulting magnetorotational instability dead zones. Indeed, if winds are as efficient at CR modulation as predicted here, short-lived radionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization (zetaRN ~ 7.3 × 10-19 s-1) in the planet-forming zone of the young solar nebula.},

@article{owe13a,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) We consider the properties of protoplanetary discs that are undergoing inside-out clearing by photoevaporation. In particular, we aim to characterise the conditions under which a protoplanetary disc may undergo `thermal sweeping', a rapid (< 1e4 years) disc destruction mechanism proposed to occur when a clearing disc reaches sufficiently low surface density at its inner edge and where the disc is unstable to runaway penetration by the X-rays. We use a large suite of 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to probe the observable parameter space, which is unfeasible in higher dimensions. These models allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will take over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as a function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find that this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity, increases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop an analytic model that reproduces these results. This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary state of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to destruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by photoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach 20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion (which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours of photoevaporation model) will not form. We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply to all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin to X-rays. It thus applies not only to the case of holes originally created by photoevaporation but also to holes formed, for example, by the tidal influence of planets.},

	Abstract = {V4046 Sagittarii AB is a close short-period classical T Tauri binary. It is a circularised and synchronised system accreting from a circumbinary disk. In 2009 it was observed as part of a coordinated program involving near-simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope and high-resolution X-ray observations with XMM-Newton. Magnetic maps of each star were derived from Zeeman-Doppler imaging. After briefly highlighting the most significant observational findings, we present a preliminary 3D model of the binary magnetosphere constructed from the magnetic maps using a newly developed binary magnetic field extrapolation code. The large-scale fields (the dipole components) of both stars are highly tilted with respect to their rotation axes, and their magnetic fields are linked.},

	Abstract = {We present results of far-infrared photometric observations with Herschel PACS of a sample of Upper Scorpius stars, with a detection rate of previously known disk-bearing K and M stars at 70, 100, and 160 micron of 71%, 56%, and 50%, respectively. We fit power-law disk models to the spectral energy distributions of K & M stars with infrared excesses, and have found that while many disks extend in to the sublimation radius, the dust has settled to lower scale heights than in disks of the less evolved Taurus-Auriga population, and have much reduced dust masses. We also conducted Herschel PACS observations for far-infrared line emission and JCMT observations for millimeter CO lines. Among B and A stars, 0 of 5 debris disk hosts exhibit gas line emission, and among K and M stars, only 2 of 14 dusty disk hosts are detected. The OI 63 micron and CII 157 micron lines are detected toward [PZ99] J160421.7-213028 and [PBB2002] J161420.3-190648, which were found in millimeter photometry to host two of the most massive dust disks remaining in the region. Comparison of the OI line emission and 63 micron continuum to that of Taurus sources suggests the emission in the former source is dominated by the disk, while in the other there is a significant contribution from a jet. The low dust masses found by disk modeling and low number of gas line detections suggest that few stars in Upper Scorpius retain sufficient quantities of material for giant planet formation. By the age of Upper Scorpius, giant planet formation is essentially complete.},

	Abstract = {The Herschel Space Observatory was used to observe ~ 120 pre-main-sequence stars in Taurus as part of the GASPS Open Time Key project. PACS was used to measure the continuum as well as several gas tracers such as [OI] 63 \mu m, [OI] 145 \mu m, [CII] 158 \mu m, OH, H2O and CO. The strongest line seen is [OI] at 63 \mu m. We find a clear correlation between the strength of the [OI] 63 \mu m line and the 63 \mu m continuum for disk sources. In outflow sources, the line emission can be up to 20 times stronger than in disk sources, suggesting that the line emission is dominated by the outflow. The tight correlation seen for disk sources suggests that the emission arises from the inner disk ($<$ 50 AU) and lower surface layers of the disk where the gas and dust are coupled. The [OI] 63 \mu m is fainter in transitional stars than in normal Class II disks. Simple SED models indicate that the dust responsible for the continuum emission is colder in these disks, leading to weaker line emission. [CII] 158 \mu m emission is only detected in strong outflow sources. The observed line ratios of [OI] 63 \mu m to [OI] 145 \mu m are in the regime where we are insensitive to the gas-to-dust ratio, neither can we discriminate between shock or PDR emission. We detect no Class III object in [OI] 63 \mu m and only three in continuum, at least one of which is a candidate debris disk.},

	Abstract = {Grain growth in protoplanetary disks is the first step towards the formation of the rocky cores of planets. Models predict that grains grow, migrate, and fragment in the disk and predict varying dust properties as a function of radius, age, and physical properties. High-angular resolution observations at more than one (sub-)mm wavelength are the essential tool for constraining grain growth and migration on the disk midplane. We developed a procedure to analyze self-consistently multi wavelength (sub-)mm continuum interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks to constrain the radial distribution of dust properties. We apply this technique to existing multi frequency continuum mm observations of the disk around CQ Tau, a A8 pre-main sequence star with a well-studied disk. We demonstrate that our models can be used to simultaneously constrain the disk and dust structure. In CQ Tau, the best-fitting model has a radial dependence of the maximum grain size, which decreases from a few cm in the inner disk (<40 AU) to a few mm at 80 AU. Nevertheless, the currently available dataset does not allow us to exclude the possibility of a uniform grain size distribution at a 3sigma level.},

	Abstract = {We report here results of spectropolarimetric observations of the classical T Tauri star DN Tau carried out (at 2 epochs) with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope within the `Magnetic Protostars and Planets' programme. We infer that DN Tau, with a photospheric temperature of 3,950+-50 K, a luminosity of 0.8+-0.2 Lsun and a rotation period of 6.32 d, is a ~2Myr-old fully-convective 0.65+-0.05 Msun star with a radius of 1.9+-0.2 Dsun, viewed at an inclination of 35+-10degr. Clear circularly-polarized Zeeman signatures are detected in both photospheric and accretion-powered emission lines, probing longitudinal fields of up to 1.8 kG (in the He1 D3 accretion proxy). Rotational modulation of Zeeman signatures, detected both in photospheric and accretion lines, is different between our 2 runs, providing further evidence that fields of cTTSs are generated by non-stationary dynamos. Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of the photospheric brightness and of the accretion-powered emission at the surface of DN Tau at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly poloidal, and largely axisymmetric, with an octupolar component (of polar strength 0.6-0.8 kG) 1.5-2.0x larger than the dipolar component (of polar strength 0.3-0.5 kG). DN Tau features dominantly poleward accretion at both epochs. The large-scale dipole component of DN Tau is however too weak to disrupt the surrounding accretion disc further than 65-90% of the corotation radius (at which the disc Keplerian period matches the stellar rotation period), suggesting that DN Tau is already spinning up despite being fully convective.},

	Abstract = {CO is an important component of a protoplanetary disc as it is one of the most abundant gas phase species. Furthermore, observations of the CO transitions can be used as a diagnostic of the gas, tracing conditions in both the inner and outer disc. We present Herschel/PACS spectroscopy of a sample of 22 Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBEs) and 8 T Tauri stars (TTS), covering the pure rotational CO transitions from J = 14-13 up to J = 49-48. CO is detected in only 5 HAEBEs, AB Aur, HD 36112, HD 97048, HD 100546 and IRS 48, and in 4 TTS, AS 205, S CrA, RU Lup, and DG Tau. The highest transition seen is J = 36-35, with Eup of 3669 K, detected in HD 100546 and DG Tau. We construct rotational diagrams for the discs with at least 3 CO detections to derive Trot, and find average temperatures of 270 K for the HAEBEs and 485 K for the TTS. HD 100546 requires an extra temperature component with Trot ~ 900-1000 K, suggesting a range of temperatures in its disc atmosphere, consistent with thermo-chemical disc models. In HAEBEs, the objects with CO detections all have flared discs in which the gas and dust are thermally decoupled. We use a small model grid to analyse our observations and find that an increased amount of flaring means higher line flux, as it increases the mass in warm gas. CO is not detected in our flat discs as the emission is below the detection limit. We find that HAEBE sources with CO detections have high Luv and strong PAH emission, again connected to the heating of the gas. In TTS, the objects with CO detections are all sources with evidence for a disc wind or outflow. For both groups of objects, sources with CO detections generally have high UV luminosity (either stellar in HAEBEs or due to accretion in TTS), but this is not a sufficient condition for the detection of the far-IR CO lines.},

	Abstract = {Massive stars play a dominant role in the process of clustered star formation, with their feedback into the molecular cloud through ionizing radiation, stellar winds and outflows. The formation process of massive stars is poorly constrained because of their scarcity, the short formation timescale and obscuration. By obtaining a census of the newly formed stellar population, the star formation history of the young cluster and the role of the massive stars within it can be unraveled. We aim to reconstruct the formation history of the young stellar population of the massive star-forming region RCW 36. We study several dozens of individual objects, both photometrically and spectroscopically, look for signs of multiple generations of young stars and investigate the role of the massive stars in this process. We obtain a census of the physical parameters and evolutionary status of the young stellar population. Using a combination of near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy we estimate ages and masses of individual objects. We identify the population of embedded young stellar objects (YSO) by their infrared colors and emission line spectra. RCW 36 harbors a stellar population of massive and intermediate-mass stars located around the center of the cluster. Class 0/I and II sources are found throughout the cluster. The central population has a median age of 1.1 +/- 0.6 Myr. Of the stars which could be classified, the most massive ones are situated in the center of the cluster. The central cluster is surrounded by filamentary cloud structures; within these, some embedded and accreting YSOs are found. Our age determination is consistent with the filamentary structures having been shaped by the ionizing radiation and stellar winds of the central massive stars. The formation of a new generation of stars is ongoing, as demonstrated by the presence of embedded protostellar clumps, and two exposed jets.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT. Because of the presence of rotation and accretion disks, classical T Tauri stars have symmetry planes that are normally inclined relative to the plane of the sky. The inclination angles affect the observed spectral properties of these objects. AIMS. We study the influence of the inclination angles on classical T Tauri star spectra in an empirical manner. METHODS. Published inclination angles, derived from the stellar photospheric rotation or from spatially resolved circumstellar disk observations, are compared with various observed spectral properties, and correlations are established and investigated. RESULTS. Inclinations derived from the stellar rotation are found to be much less accurate than the published disk inclinations, and no significant correlations between spectral properties and inclinations based on rotation data could be detected. In contrast, significant correlations are found between the disk inclination angles and the apparent velocities observed for the forbidden emission lines and the wind absorption features of permitted lines. These data support the assumption of cone-like polar winds with opening angles smaller than $\approx 45^\circ$. Other spectral features show weaker or no inclination dependence. Using these results, the true (deprojected) flow velocities of the polar winds are derived for the investigated sample of T Tauri stars. Deprojected wind-ejection velocities appear to differ by a factor of two among the stars in our sample, which spans a range of mass-loss rates from $10^{-10} $M$_\odot$/yr to $3 \times 10^{-7} $M$_\odot$/yr.},

	Abstract = {The dust sublimation walls of disks around T Tauri stars represent a directly observable cross-section through the disk atmosphere and midplane. Their emission properties can probe the grain size distribution and composition of the innermost regions of the disk, where terrestrial planets form. Here we calculate the inner dust sublimation wall properties for four classical T Tauri stars with a narrow range of spectral types and inclination angles and a wide range of mass accretion rates to determine the extent to which the walls are radially curved. Best-fits to the near- and mid-IR excesses are found for curved, 2-layer walls in which the lower layer contains larger, hotter, amorphous pyroxene grains with Mg/(Mg+Fe)=0.6 and the upper layer contains submicron, cooler, mixed amorphous olivine and forsterite grains. As the mass accretion rates decrease from 10^(-8) to 10^(-10) Msol/yr, the maximum grain size in the lower layer decreases from 3 to 0.5 microns. We attribute this to a decrease in fragmentation and turbulent support for micron-sized grains with decreasing viscous heating. The atmosphere of these disks is depleted of dust with dust-gas mass ratios 1x10^(-4) of the ISM value, while the midplane is enhanced to 8 times the ISM value. For all accretion rates, the wall contributes at least half of the flux in the optically thin 10 micron silicate feature. Finally, we find evidence for an iron gradient in the disk, suggestive of that found in our solar system.},

	Abstract = {RW Aur A is a classical T Tauri star, believed to have undergone a reconfiguration of its circumstellar environment as a consequence of a recent fly-by of its stellar companion, RW Aur B. This interaction stripped away part of its circumstellar disk, leaving a tidally disrupted "arm" feature and a short truncated disk. We present photometric observations of the RW Aur system from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT-North) showing a long and deep eclipse that occurred from September of 2010 until March of 2011. The eclipse has a depth of ~2 magnitudes and a duration of ~180 days, similar to individual eclipses of Epsilon Aurigae. The eclipse was confirmed by archival observations from American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). We suggest that this eclipse is the result of a portion of the tidally disrupted disk occulting RW Aur A. The calculated transverse linear velocity of the occulter is in excellent agreement with the measured relative velocity of the tidally disrupted arm. Using simple kinematic and geometric arguments, we show that the occulter cannot be a feature of the RW Aur A circumstellar disk, and we also discount other hypotheses. We also place constraints on the (projected) thickness and semi-major axis of the portion of the arm that occulted the star.},

	Abstract = {We present results from an Halpha emission-line survey in a one square degree area centered on the Orion Nebula Cluster, obtained with the Wide Field Grism Spectrograph-2 on the 2.2-meter telescope of the University of Hawaii. We identified 587 stars with Halpha emission, 99 of which, located mainly in the outer regions of the observed area, have not appeared in previous Halpha surveys. We determined the equivalent width (EW) of the line, and based on it classified 372 stars as classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and 187 as weak line T Tauri stars (WTTS). Simultaneous r', i' photometry indicates a limiting magnitude of r' ~ 20 mag, but the sample is incomplete at r' > 17 mag. The surface distribution of the Halpha emission stars reveals a clustered and a dispersed population, the former consisting of younger and more massive young stars than the latter. Comparison of the derived EWs with those found in the literature indicates variability of the Halpha line. We found that the typical amplitudes of the variability are not greater than a factor 2-3 in the most cases. We identified a subgroup of low-EW stars with infrared signatures indicative of optically thick accretion disks. We studied the correlations between the equivalent width and other properties of the stars. Based on literature data we examined several properties of our CTTS and WTTS subsamples and found significant differences in mid-infrared color indices, average rotational periods, and spectral energy distribution characteristics of the subsamples.},

	Abstract = {We study the association of solar flares with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during the deep, extended solar minimum of 2007-2009, using extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light (coronagraph) images from the {\it Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory} (STEREO). Although all of the fast (v $>$ 900 km s$^{-1}$) {\it and} wide ($\theta >$ 100$\arcdeg$) CMEs are associated with a flare that is at least identified in GOES soft X-ray light curves, a majority of flares with relatively high X-ray intensity for the deep solar minimum (e.g. $\gtrsim$1 \times 10^{-6}$ W m$^{-2}$ or C1) are not associated with CMEs. Intense flares tend to occur in active regions with strong and complex photospheric magnetic field, but the active regions that produce CME-associated flares tend to be small, including those that have no sunspots and therefore no NOAA active-region numbers. Other factors on scales comparable to and larger than active regions seem to exist that contribute to the association of flares with CMEs. We find the possible low coronal signatures of CMEs, namely eruptions, dimmings, EUV waves, and Type III bursts, in 91%, 74%, 57%, and 74%, respectively, of the 35 flares that we associate with CMEs. None of these observables can fully replace direct observations of CMEs by coronagraphs.},

	Abstract = {We consider continuum free-free radio emission from the upper atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation within the framework of EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust tail of the disc and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14-18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combing observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV driven disc dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray driven disc dispersal.},

	Abstract = {We present a homogeneous survey of line and continuum emission from near-ultraviolet (NUV) to optical wavelengths during twenty M dwarf flares with simultaneous, high cadence photometry and spectra. These data were obtained to study the white-light continuum components at bluer and redder wavelengths than the Balmer jump. Our goals were to break the degeneracy between emission mechanisms that have been fit to broadband colors of flares and to provide constraints for radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) flare models that seek to reproduce the white-light flare emission. The main results from the continuum analysis are the following: 1) the detection of Balmer continuum (in emission) that is present during all flares and with a wide range of relative contributions to the continuum flux at bluer wavelengths than the Balmer jump; 2) a blue continuum at flare maximum that is linearly decreasing with wavelength from \lambda = 4000-4800\AA, matched by the spectral shape of hot, blackbody emission with typical temperatures of T_{BB}~9000-14,000 K; 3) a redder continuum apparent at wavelengths longer than H\beta\ (\lambda > 4900\AA) which becomes relatively more important to the energy budget during the late gradual phase. We calculate Balmer jump flux ratios and compare to RHD model spectra. The model ratios are too large and the blue-optical (\lambda = 4000-4800\AA) slopes are too red in both the impulsive and gradual decay phases of all twenty flares. This discrepancy implies that further work is needed to understand the heating at high column mass during dMe flares. (Abridged)},

	Abstract = {We have updated our publicly available dust radiative transfer code (HOCHUNK3D) to include new emission processes and various 3-D geometries appropriate for forming stars. The 3-D geometries include warps and spirals in disks, accretion hotspots on the central star, fractal clumping density enhancements, and misaligned inner disks. Additional axisymmetric (2-D) features include gaps in disks and envelopes, "puffed-up inner rims" in disks, multiple bipolar cavity walls, and iteration of disk vertical structure assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We include the option for simple power-law envelope geometry, which combined with fractal clumping, and bipolar cavities, can be used to model evolved stars as well as protostars. We include non-thermal emission from PAHs and very small grains, and external illumination from the interstellar radiation field. The grid structure was modified to allow multiple dust species in each cell; based on this, a simple prescription is implemented to model dust stratification. We describe these features in detail, and show example calculations of each. Some of the more interesting results include the following: 1) Outflow cavities may be more clumpy than infalling envelopes. 2) PAH emission in high-mass stars may be a better indicator of evolutionary stage than the broadband SED slope; and related to this, 3) externally illuminated clumps and high-mass stars in optically thin clouds can masquerade as YSOs. 4) Our hydrostatic equilibrium models suggest that dust settling is likely ubiquitous in T Tauri disks, in agreement with previous observations.},

	Abstract = {We present source catalogs for the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S), which is the deepest Chandra survey to date and covers an area of 464.5 arcmin2. We provide a main Chandra source catalog, which contains 740 X-ray sources that are detected with WAVDETECT at a false-positive probability threshold of 10-5 in at least one of three X-ray bands (0.5-8 keV, full band; 0.5-2 keV, soft band; and 2-8 keV, hard band) and also satisfy a binomial-probability source-selection criterion of P < 0.004 (i.e., the probability of sources not being real is less than 0.004); this approach is designed to maximize the number of reliable sources detected. A total of 300 main-catalog sources are new compared to the previous 2 Ms CDF-S main-catalog sources. We determine X-ray source positions using centroid and matched-filter techniques and obtain a median positional uncertainty of ‚{\^a}{\`a}0farcs42. We also provide a supplementary catalog, which consists of 36 sources that are detected with WAVDETECT at a false-positive probability threshold of 10-5, satisfy the condition of 0.004 < P < 0.1, and have an optical counterpart with R < 24. Multiwavelength identifications, basic optical/infrared/radio photometry, and spectroscopic/photometric redshifts are provided for the X-ray sources in the main and supplementary catalogs. Seven hundred sixteen (‚{\^a}{\`a}97%) of the 740 main-catalog sources have multiwavelength counterparts, with 673 (‚{\^a}{\`a}94% of 716) having either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. The 740 main-catalog sources span broad ranges of full-band flux and 0.5-8 keV luminosity; the 300 new main-catalog sources span similar ranges although they tend to be systematically lower. Basic analyses of the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of the sources indicate that >75% of the main-catalog sources are active galactic nuclei (AGNs); of the 300 new main-catalog sources, about 35% are likely normal and starburst galaxies, reflecting the rise of normal and starburst galaxies at the very faint flux levels uniquely accessible to the 4 Ms CDF-S. Near the center of the 4 Ms CDF-S (i.e., within an off-axis angle of 3'), the observed AGN and galaxy source densities have reached 9800+1300 - 1100 deg-2 and 6900+1100 - 900 deg-2, respectively. Simulations show that our main catalog is highly reliable and is reasonably complete. The mean backgrounds (corrected for vignetting and exposure-time variations) are 0.063 and 0.178 counts Ms-1 pixel-1 (for a pixel size of 0farcs492) for the soft and hard bands, respectively; the majority of the pixels have zero background counts. The 4 Ms CDF-S reaches on-axis flux limits of ‚{\^a}{\`a}3.2 √{\'o} 10-17, 9.1 √{\'o} 10-18, and 5.5 √{\'o} 10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 for the full, soft, and hard bands, respectively. An increase in the CDF-S exposure time by a factor of ‚{\^a}{\`a}2-2.5 would provide further significant gains and probe key unexplored discovery space.},

	Abstract = {The method of obtaining confidence intervals on a subset of the total number of parameters (p) of a model used for fitting X-ray spectra is to perturb the best-fitting model until, for each parameter, a range is found for which the change in the fit statistic is equal to some critical value. This critical value corresponds to the desired confidence level and is obtained from the chi 2 distribution for q degrees of freedom, where q is the number of interesting parameters. With the advent of better energy-resolution detectors, such as those on board ASCA, it has become more common to fit complex models with narrow features, comparable to the instrumental energy resolution. To investigate whether this leads to significant non-Gaussian deviations between data and model, we use simulations based on ASCA data, and we show that the method is still valid in such cases. We also investigate the weak-source limit as well as the case of obtaining upper limits on equivalent widths of weak emission lines and find that, for all practical purposes, the method gives the correct confidence ranges. However, upper limits on emission-line equivalent widths may be overestimated in the extreme Poisson limit.},

	Abstract = {We present results from an extensive number of PSPC spectral fitting simulations, performed with the aim to ascertain the dependence of the quality of the fit on photon counting statistics. In particular, we investigate the reliability of the results and their sensitivity to the assumed model in the case of X-ray emission from optically thin plasmas in thermal equilibrium, typical of stellar coronae and supernova remnants. We consider both single-temperature and two-temperature Raymond-Smith emission models, and the effects of contamination from either low or relatively high diffuse X-ray background. We explore the relative errors on the fitted temperatures derived from the simulations, and discuss constraints on the inferences that can be drawn regarding the existence of two components with different temperatures and emission measures in the observed spectrum. We also discuss the possibility that the presence of two components could be erroneously inferred from the analysis of a single-temperature spectrum. Moreover, we address the issue of the statistical independence of the spectral bins used in the fit by testing the agreement of the distribution of chi^2^ values obtained from the simulations with the theoretical distribution. Finally, we briefly investigate advantages and drawbacks of using the C statistics as an alternative to the chi^2^ statistics.},

	Abstract = {The HeII (1640 A) line and the resonance doublet of NV (UV1) provide a good diagnostic tool to constrain the excitation mechanism of hot (Te>40,000K) atmospheric/magnetospheric plasmas in T Tauri stars (TTSs). Making use of the data available in the Hubble Space Telescope Archive, this work shows that there are, at least, two distinct physical components contributing to the radiation in these tracers: the accretion flow sliding on the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. The NV profiles are symmetric and at rest with respect to the star in most sources. The velocity dispersion of the profile increases from non-accreting (40 km/s) to accreting (120 km/s) TTSs suggesting that the macroturbulence in the line formation region decreases as the stars approach the main sequence. Evidence of the NV line being formed in a hot solar-like wind has been found in RW Aur, HN Tau and AA Tau. The HeII profile has a strong narrow component that dominates the line flux; the dispersion of this component ranges from 20 to 60 km/s. The sources of this radiation is uncertain. Current data suggest that both accretion shocks and atmospheric emission might contribute to the line flux. In some sources de HeII line shows a broad and rewards shifted emission component often accompanied by semiforbidden OIII emission that has a critical density of about 3.4e10 cm-3. In spite of the different origins (inferred from the kinematics of the line formation region), NV and HeII fluxes are strongly correlated, with the possible exception of the heaviest accretors.},

	Abstract = {We present a 0.5-2.2 micron scattered light spectrum of the circumstellar disk around TW Hya from a combination of spatially resolved HST STIS spectroscopy and NICMOS coronagraphic images of the disk. We investigate the morphology of the disk at distances > 40 AU over this wide range of wavelengths, and identify the presence of a depression in surface brightness at ~80 AU that could be caused by a gap in the disk. Additionally, we quantify the surface brightness, azimuthal symmetry, and spectral character of the disk as a function of radius. Our analysis shows that the scattering efficiency of the dust is largely neutral to blue over the observed wavelengths. We model the disk as a steady alpha-disk with an ad hoc gap structure. The thermal properties of the disk are self-consistently calculated using a three-dimensional radiative transfer code that uses ray-tracing to model the heating of the disk interior and scattered light images. We find a good fit to the data over a wide range of distances from the star if we use a model disk with a partially filled gap of 30% depth at 80 AU and with a self-similar truncation knee at 100 AU. The origin of the gap is unclear, but it could arise from a transition in the nature of the disk's dust composition or the presence of a planetary companion. Based on scalings to previous hydrodynamic simulations of gap opening criteria for embedded proto-planets, we estimate that a planetary companion forming the gap could have a mass between 6-28 M_Earth.},

	Abstract = {A sample of 70 magnetically active stars toward the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region has been investigated. The positions of the sample stars on the Rossby diagram have been analyzed. All stars are shown to be in the regime of a saturated dynamo, where the X-ray luminosity reaches its maximum and does not depend on the Rossby number. A correlation has been found between the lithium line equivalent width and the age of a solar-mass (from 0.7 to 1.2 Msun) pre-main-sequence star. The older the age, the smaller the Li line equivalent width. Analysis of the long-term photometric variability of these stars has shown that the photometric activity of the youngest stars is appreciably higher than that of the older objects from the sample. This result can be an indirect confirmation of the evolution of the magnetic field in pre-main-sequence stars from predominantly dipole and axisymmetric to multipole and nonaxisymmetric.},

Here we present spectra of the v=2->0 and v=3->1 bandheads of ro-vibrational transitions of carbon monoxide. We observed these spectra over multiple epochs spaced by a few days and approximately one month. Several of our targets show CO emission or absorption features. However we see little evidence of variability in these features across multiple epochs.

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of near-infrared time-series photometry in J, H, and K bands for about 100 epochs of a 1 square degree region of the Lynds 1003/1004 dark cloud in the Cygnus OB7 region. Augmented by data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we identify 96 candidate disk bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region. Of these, 30 are clearly Class I or earlier. Using the Wide-Field imaging CAMera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT), we were able to obtain photometry over three observing seasons, with photometric uncertainty better than 0.05 mag down to J ~17. We study detailed light curves and color trajectories of ~50 of the YSOs in the monitored field. We investigate the variability and periodicity of the YSOs and find the data are consistent with all YSOs being variable in these wavelengths on time scales of a few years. We divide the variability into four observational classes: 1) stars with periodic variability stable over long timescales, 2) variables which exhibit short-lived cyclic behavior, 3) long duration variables, and 4) stochastic variables. Some YSO variability defies simple classification. We can explain much of the observed variability as being due to dynamic and rotational changes in the disk, including an asymmetric or changing blocking fraction, changes to the inner disk hole size, as well as changes to the accretion rate. Overall, we find that the Class I:Class II ratio of the cluster is consistent with an age of < 1Myr, with at least one individual, wildly varying, source ~ 100,000 yr old. We have also discovered a Class II eclipsing binary system with a period of 17.87 days.},

	Abstract = {We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including PMS to ZAMS spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-MS convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.},

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared coronagraphic imaging polarimetry of RY Tau. The scattered light in the circumstellar environment was imaged at H-band at a high resolution (~0".05) for the first time, using Subaru-HiCIAO. The observed polarized intensity (PI) distribution shows a butterfly-like distribution of bright emission with an angular scale similar to the disk observed at millimeter wavelengths. This distribution is offset toward the blueshifted jet, indicating the presence of a geometrically thick disk or a remnant envelope, and therefore the earliest stage of the Class II evolutionary phase. We perform comparisons between the observed PI distribution and disk models with: (1) full radiative transfer code, using the spectral energy distribution (SED) to constrain the disk parameters; and (2) monochromatic simulations of scattered light which explore a wide range of parameters space to constrain the disk and dust parameters. We show that these models cannot consistently explain the observed PI distribution, SED, and the viewing angle inferred by millimeter interferometry. We suggest that the scattered light in the near-infrared is associated with an optically thin and geometrically thick layer above the disk surface, with the surface responsible for the infrared SED. Half of the scattered light and thermal radiation in this layer illuminates the disk surface, and this process may significantly affect the thermal structure of the disk.},

	Abstract = {We have used medium resolution spectra to search for evidence that proto-stellar objects accrete at high rates during their early 'assembly phase'. Models predict that depleted lithium and reduced luminosity in T-Tauri stars are key signatures of 'cold' high-rate accretion occurring early in a star's evolution. We found no evidence in 168 stars in NGC 2264 and the Orion Nebula Cluster for strong lithium depletion through analysis of veiling corrected 6708 angstrom lithium spectral line strengths. This suggests that 'cold' accretion at high rates (M_dot > 5 x 10-4 M_sol yr-1) occurs in the assembly phase of fewer than 0.5 per cent of 0.3 < M < 1.9 M_sol stars. We also find that the dispersion in the strength of the 6708 angstrom lithium line might imply an age spread that is similar in magnitude to the apparent age spread implied by the luminosity dispersion seen in colour magnitude diagrams. Evidence for weak lithium depletion (< 10 per cent in equivalent width) that is correlated with luminosity is also apparent, but we are unable to determine whether age spreads or accretion at rates less than 5 x 10-4 M_sol yr-1 are responsible.},

	Abstract = {Ices regulate much of the chemistry during star formation and account for up to 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN, and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in an H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freezeout levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation, and the formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances is consistent with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin.},

@article{sal13,
	Abstract = {In this work, we introduce the use of H I Pfund beta (Pfbeta 4.6538 mum) as a tracer of mass accretion from protoplanetary disks onto young stars. Pfbeta was serendipitously observed in NIRSPEC and CRIRES surveys of CO fundamental emission, amounting to a sample size of 120 young stars with detected Pfbeta emission. Using a subsample of disks with previously measured accretion luminosities, we show that Pfbeta line luminosity is well correlated with accretion luminosity over a range of at least three orders of magnitude. We use this correlation to derive accretion luminosities for all 120 targets, 65 of which are previously unreported in the literature. The conversion from accretion luminosity to accretion rate is limited by the availability of stellar mass and radius measurements; nevertheless, we also report accretion rates for 67 targets, 16 previously unmeasured. Our large sample size and our ability to probe high extinction values allow for relatively unbiased comparisons between different types of disks. We find that the transitional disks in our sample have lower than average Pfbeta line luminosities, and thus accretion luminosities, at a marginally significant level. We also show that high Pfbeta equivalent width is a signature of transitional disks with high inner disk gas/dust ratios. In contrast, we find that disks with signatures of slow disk winds have Pfbeta luminosities comparable to those of other disks in our sample. Finally, we investigate accretion rates for stage I disks, including significantly embedded targets. We find that stage I and stage II disks have statistically indistinguishable Pfbeta line luminosities, implying similar accretion rates, and that the accretion rates of stage I disks are too low to be consistent with quiescent accretion. Our results are instead consistent with both observational and theoretical evidence that stage I objects experience episodic, rather than quiescent, accretion.},

	Abstract = {GASPS is a far-infrared line and continuum survey of protoplanetary and young debris disks using PACS on the Herschel Space Observatory. The survey includes [OI] at 63 microns, as well as 70, 100 and 160um continuum, with the brightest objects also studied in [OI]145um, [CII]157um, H2O and CO. Targets included T Tauri stars and debris disks in 7 nearby young associations, and a sample of isolated Herbig AeBe stars. The aim was to study the global gas and dust content in a wide disk sample, systemically comparing the results with models. In this paper we review the main aims, target selection and observing strategy. We show initial results, including line identifications, sources detected, and a first statistical study. [OI]63um was the brightest line in most objects, by a factor of ~10. Detection rates were 49%, including 100% of HAeBe stars and 43% of T Tauri stars. Comparison with published dust masses show a dust threshold for [OI]63um detection of ~1e-5 M_solar. Normalising to 140pc distance, 32% with mass 1e-6 - 1e-5 M_solar, and a small number with lower mass were also detected. This is consistent with moderate UV excess and disk flaring. In most cases, continuum and line emission is spatially and spectrally unresolved, suggesting disk emission. ~10 objects were resolved, likely from outflows. Detection rates in [OI]145um, [CII]157um and CO J=18-17 were 20-40%, but [CII] was not correlated with disk mass, suggesting it arises instead from a compact envelope. [OI] detection rates in T Tauri associations of ages 0.3-4Myr were ~50%. ~2 stars were detectable in associations of 5-20Myr, with no detections in associations of age >20Myr. Comparing with the total number of young stars, and assuming a ISM-like gas/dust ratio, this indicates that ~18% of stars retain a gas-rich disk of total mass >1M_Jupiter for 1-4Myr, 1-7% keep such disks for 5-10Myr, and none remain beyond 10-20Myr.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique, quantile analysis, to classify the spectral properties of X-ray sources with limited statistics. Quantile analysis is superior to conventional approaches, such as X-ray hardness ratio or X-ray color analysis, for studying relatively faint sources or investigating a certain phase or state of a source in detail, where poor statistics do not allow spectral fitting using a model. Instead of working with predetermined energy bands, we determine the energy values that divide the detected photons into predetermined fractions of the total counts, such as the median (50%), terciles (33% and 67%), and quartiles (25% and 75%). We use these quantiles as an indicator of the X-ray hardness or color of the source. We show that the median is an improved substitute for the conventional X-ray hardness ratio. The median and other quantiles form a phase space, similar to the conventional X-ray color-color diagrams. The quantile-based phase space is more evenly sensitive over various spectral shapes than the conventional color-color diagrams, and it is naturally arranged to properly represent the statistical similarity of various spectral shapes. We demonstrate the new technique in the 0.3-8 keV energy range using the Chandra ACIS-S detector response function and a typical aperture photometry involving background subtraction. The technique can be applied in any energy band, provided the energy distribution of photons can be obtained.},

	Abstract = {We report on the Herschel Gould Belt survey (HGBS) of ChaII, focusing on the detection of Class I to III young stellar objects (YSOs). We aim at characterizing the circumstellar material around these YSOs and understanding which disk parameters are most likely constrained by the new HGBS data. We recovered 29 out of the 63 known YSOs in ChaII with a detection in at least one of the PACS/SPIRE pass-bands: 3 Class I YSOs (i.e.,100%), 1 Flat source (i.e., 50%), 21 Class II objects (i.e., 55%), 3 Class III objects (i.e, 16%) and the unclassified source IRAS 12522-7640. We explore PACS/SPIRE colors of this sample and present modeling of their SEDs using the RADMC-2D radiative transfer code. We find that YSO colors are confined in specific regions of PACS/SPIRE color-color diagrams. These color ranges are expected to be only marginally contaminated by extragalactic sources and field stars and, hence, provide a useful YSO selection tool when applied altogether. We were able to model the SED of 26 out of the 29 detected YSOs. We discuss the degeneracy/limitations of our SED fitting results and adopt the Bayesian method to estimate the probability of different values for the derived disk parameters. The Cha II YSOs present typical disk inner radii around 0.1 AU. The lower limit to Rc is typically around 50 AU. The lower limits to Mdisk are proportional to the stellar masses with a typical 0.3% ratio, i.e., in the range estimated in the literature for young Class II stars and brown dwarfs across a broad range of stellar masses. The estimated flaring angles, although very uncertain, point towards rather flat disks (1+phi less than 1.2), as found for low-mass M-type YSO samples in other star forming regions. Thus, our results support the idea that disk properties show a dependence on stellar properties.},

	Abstract = {Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is the most promising mechanism behind accretion in low-mass protostellar disks. Here we present the first analysis of the global structure and evolution of non-ideal MRI-driven T-Tauri disks on million-year timescales. We accomplish this in a 1+1D simulation by calculating magnetic diffusivities and utilizing turbulence activity criteria to determine thermal structure and accretion rate without resorting to a 3-D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. Our major findings are as follows. First, even for modest surface densities of just a few times the minimum-mass solar nebula, the dead zone encompasses the giant planet-forming region, preserving any compositional gradients. Second, the surface density of the active layer is nearly constant in time at roughly 10 g/cm2, which we use to derive a simple prescription for viscous heating in MRI-active disks for those who wish to avoid detailed MHD computations. Furthermore, unlike a standard disk with constant-alpha viscosity, the disk midplane does not cool off over time, though the surface cools as the star evolves along the Hayashi track. The ice line is firmly in the terrestrial planet-forming region throughout disk evolution and can move either inward or outward with time, depending on whether pileups form near the star. Finally, steady-state mass transport is a poor description of flow through an MRI-active disk. We caution that MRI activity is sensitive to many parameters, including stellar X-ray flux, grain size, gas/small grain mass ratio and magnetic field strength, and we have not performed an exhaustive parameter study here.},

	Abstract = {X-ray sources with very few counts can be identified with low-noise X-ray detectors such as the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. These sources are often too faint for parametric spectral modeling using well-established methods such as fitting with XSPEC. We discuss the estimation of apparent and intrinsic broadband X-ray fluxes and soft X-ray absorption from gas along the line of sight to these sources, using nonparametric methods. Apparent flux is estimated from the ratio of the source count rate to the instrumental effective area averaged over the chosen band. Absorption, intrinsic flux, and errors on these quantities are estimated from comparison of source photometric quantities with those of high signal-to-noise spectra that were simulated using spectral models characteristic of the class of astrophysical sources under study. The concept of this method is similar to the long-standing use of color-magnitude diagrams in optical and infrared astronomy, with X-ray median energy replacing color index and X-ray source counts replacing magnitude. Our nonparametric method is tested against the apparent spectra of ~2000 faint sources in the Chandra observation of the rich young stellar cluster in the M 17 H II region. We show that the intrinsic X-ray properties can be determined with little bias and reasonable accuracy using these observable photometric quantities without employing often uncertain and time-consuming methods of nonlinear parametric spectral modeling. Our method is calibrated for thermal spectra characteristic of stars in young stellar clusters, but recalibration should be possible for some other classes of faint X-ray sources such as extragalactic active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Since 2004, we have been engaged in a long-term observing programme to monitor young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We have collected about 2000 frames in V, R and I broad-band filters on more than 200 nights distributed over five consecutive observing seasons. The high-quality and time-extended photometric data give us an opportunity to address various phenomena associated with young stars. The prime motivations of this project are (i) to explore various manifestations of stellar magnetic activity in very young low-mass stars, (ii) to search for new pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries and (iii) to look for any EXor and FUor-like transient activities associated with YSOs. Since this is the first paper on this programme, we give a detailed description of the science drivers, the observation and the data reduction strategies as well. In addition to these, we also present a large number of new periodic variables detected from our first 5 yr of time-series photometric data. Our study reveals that about 72 per cent of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) in our field of view are periodic, whereas only 32 per cent of weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTS) are periodic. This indicates that inhomogeneity patterns on the surface of CTTS of the ONC stars are much more stable than on WTTS. From our multiyear monitoring campaign, we found that the photometric surveys based on single season are incapable of identifying all periodic variables. And any study on evolution of angular momentum based on single-season surveys must be carried out with caution.},

	Abstract = {Periodic variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) offers indirect evidence for an active dynamical mechanism. Starspots, accretion, stellar companions, and disk veiling can contribute to the photometric variability of YSOs. As part of an ongoing study of the Rho Oph star forming region, we report the discovery of 92.6 day periodic variations for the Class I YSO YLW 16A, observed over a period of three years. A SED model was fit to available photometric data for the object. We propose a triple-system with an inner binary with a period of 93 days eclipsed by a warped circum-binary disk. The nature of the secondary is unconstrained and could be stellar or sub-stellar. We report the discovery of a tertiary companion at a projected separation of ~40 AU that could account for the circum-binary disk warp. This light curve and model is similar to the model we proposed for WL 4 in previous work. Understanding these systems may lead to insights about the nature of stellar evolution and planetary formation, and provide valuable benchmarks for future theoretical modeling and near- and mid-infrared synoptic surveys of YSOs.},

	Abstract = {Emission-line variability data for Seyfert 1 galaxies provide strong evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of these galaxies and that the line-emitting gas is moving in the gravitational potential of that black hole. The time-delayed response of the emission lines to continuum variations is used to infer the size of the line-emitting region, which is then combined with measurements of the Doppler widths of the variable line components to estimate a virial mass. In the case of the best-studied galaxy, NGC 5548, various emission lines spanning an order of magnitude in distance from the central source show the expected V~r-1/2 correlation between distance and line width and are thus consistent with a single value for the mass. Two other Seyfert galaxies, NGC 7469 and 3C 390.3, show a similar relationship. We compute the ratio of luminosity to mass for these three objects and the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 and find that the gravitational force on the line-emitting gas is much stronger than radiation pressure. These results strongly support the paradigm of gravitationally bound broad emission line region clouds.},

	Abstract = {An investigation is made of disc accretion of matter on to a rotating star with an aligned dipole magnetic field. A new aspect of this work is that we argue that, when the angular velocities of the star and disc differ sustantially, the B field linking the star and disc rapidly inflates to give regions of open field lines extending from the polar caps of the star and from the disc. The open field line region of the disc leads to the possibility of magnetically driven outflows. An analysis is made of the outflows and their back effect on the disc structure, assuming an `alpha' turbulent viscosity model for the disc and a magnetic diffusivity comparable to this viscosity. The outflows are found to extend over a range of radial distances inward to a distance close to r_to, which is the distance of the maximum of the angular rotation rate of the disc. We find that r_to depends on the star's magnetic moment, the accretion rate, and the disc's magnetic diffusivity. The outflow regime is accompanied in general by a spin-up of the rotation rate of the star. When r_to exceeds the star's corotation radius r_cr=(GM/omega^2*)^1/3, we argue that outflow solutions do not occur, but instead that `magnetic braking' of the star by the disc due to field-line twisting occurs in the vicinity of r_cr. The magnetic braking solutions can give spin-up or spin-down (or no spin change) of the star, depending mainly on the star's magnetic moment and the mass accretion rate. For a system with r_to comparable to r_cr, bimodal behaviour is possible where extraneous perturbations (for example, intermittency of alpha, B field flux introduced from the companion star, or variations in the mass accretion rate) cause the system to flip between spin-up (with outflows, r_to<r_cr) and spin-down (or spin-up) (with no outflows, r_to>r_cr).},

	Abstract = {Observations of pre-main-sequence star rotation periods reveal slow rotators in young clusters of various ages, indicating that angular momentum is somehow removed from these rotating masses. The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as young stars contract has been one of the longest standing problems in star formation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that magnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates these rotation periods have produced mixed results. In this paper, we use the unprecedented disk identification capability of the Spitzer Space Telescope to test the star-disk interaction paradigm in two young clusters, NGC 2264 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We show that once mass effects and sensitivity biases are removed, a clear increase in the disk fraction with period can be observed in both clusters across the entire period range populated by cluster members. We also show that the long-period peak (P~8 days) of the bimodal distribution observed for high-mass stars in the ONC is dominated by a population of stars possessing a disk, while the short-period peak (P~2 days) is dominated by a population of stars without a disk. Our results represent the strongest evidence to date that star-disk interaction regulates the angular momentum of these young stars. This study will make possible quantitative comparisons between the observed period distributions of stars with and without a disk and numerical models of the angular momentum evolution of young stars.},

	Abstract = {We assess the potential of planet formation instigating the early formation of a photoevaporation-driven gap, up to radii larger than typical for photoevaporation alone. For our investigation we make use of hydrodynamic models of photoevaporating discs with a giant planet embedded. We find that by reducing the mass accretion flow on to the star, discs that form giant planets will be dispersed at earlier times than discs without planets by X-ray photoevaporation. By clearing the portion of the disc inner of the planet orbital radius, planet formation induced photoevaporation (PIPE) is able to produce transition discs that for a given mass accretion rate have larger holes when compared to standard X-ray photoevaporation. This constitutes a possible route for the formation of the observed class of accreting transition discs with large holes, which are otherwise difficult to explain by planet formation or photoevaporation alone. Moreover, assuming that a planet is able to filter dust completely, PIPE produces a transition disc with a large hole and may provide a mechanism to quickly shut down accretion. This process appears to be too slow, however, to explain the observed desert in the population of transition discs with large holes and low mass accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {Context. The CoRoT satellite has recently discovered a hot Jupiter that transits across the disc of a F9 main-sequence star called CoRoT-6 with a period of 8.886 days.  Aims: We model the photospheric activity of the star and use the maps of the active regions to study stellar differential rotation and the star-planet interaction.  Methods: We apply a maximum entropy spot model to fit the optical modulation as observed by CoRoT during a uninterrupted interval of ~ 140 days. Photospheric active regions are assumed to consist of spots and faculae in a fixed proportion with solar-like contrasts.  Results: Individual active regions have lifetimes up to 30-40 days. Most of them form and decay within five active longitudes whose different migration rates are attributed to the stellar differential rotation for which a lower limit of DeltaOmega/Omega = 0.12 ¬$\pm$ 0.02 is obtained. Several active regions show a maximum of activity at a longitude lagging the subplanetary point by ~ 200¬∞ with the probability of a chance occurrence being smaller than 1 percent.  Conclusions: Our spot modelling indicates that the photospheric activity of CoRoT-6 could be partially modulated by some kind of star-planet magnetic interaction, while an interaction related to tides is highly unlikely because of the weakness of the tidal force.  Based on observations obtained with CoRoT, a space project operated by the French Space Agency, CNES, with partecipation of the Science Programme of ESA, ESTEC/RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.},

	Abstract = {We report new magnetic field measurements for 14 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main-sequence star measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very strong fields on these stars, which decreases the efficiency with which gas motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.},

	Abstract = {We report results of the first global three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the waves excited in an accretion disc by a rotating star with a dipole magnetic field misaligned from the star's rotation axis (which is aligned with the disc axis). The main results are the following. (1) If the magnetosphere of the star corotates approximately with the inner disc, then we observe a strong one-armed bending wave (a warp). This warp corotates with the star and has a maximum amplitude between corotation radius and the radius of the vertical resonance. The disc's centre of mass can deviate from the equatorial plane up to the distance of zw ‚{\^a}{\`a} 0.1r. However, the effective height of the warp can be larger, hw ‚{\^a}{\`a} 0.3r, due to the finite thickness of the disc. Stars with a range of misalignment angles excite warps. However, the amplitude of the warps is larger for misalignment angles between 15¬∞ and 60¬∞. The location and amplitude of the warp do not depend on viscosity, at least for relatively small values of the standard alpha-parameter, up to 0.08. (2) If the magnetosphere rotates slower than the inner disc, then a bending wave is excited at the disc-magnetosphere boundary, but does not form a large-scale warp. Instead, persistent, high-frequency oscillations become strong at the inner region of the disc. These are (a) trapped density waves which form inside the radius where the disc angular velocity has a maximum, and (b) inner bending waves which appear in the case of accretion through magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability. These two types of waves are connected with the inner disc and their frequencies will vary with accretion rate. Bending oscillations at lower frequencies are also excited including global oscillations of the disc. In cases where the simulation region is small, slowly precessing warp forms with the maximum amplitude at the vertical resonance. The present simulations are applicable to young stars, cataclysmic variables and accreting millisecond pulsars. A large-amplitude warp of an accretion disc can periodically obscure the light from the star. Different types of waves can be responsible for both the high- and low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in different types of stars. Inner disc waves can also leave an imprint on frequencies observed in moving hot spots on the surface of the star.},

	Abstract = {The maximum amplitude (Amax) of spot-induced brightness variations from long-term V-band photometry and the ratio LX/Lbol between X-ray and bolometric luminosities are suitable indicators of the level of magnetic activity in the photosphere and in the corona of late-type stars, respectively. By using these activity indicators we investigate the dependence of coronal X-ray emission on the level of photospheric starspot activity in a homogeneous sample of low mass main sequence field and cluster stars of different ages (IC 2602, IC 4665, IC 2391, alpha Persei, Pleiades and Hyades). First, the activity-rotation connection at the photospheric level is re-analysed, as well as its dependence on spectral type and age. The upper envelope of Amax increases monotonically with decreasing rotational period (P) and Rossby number (R0) showing a break around 1.1 d that separates two rotation regimes where the starspot activity shows different behaviours. The Amax-P and Amax-R0 relations are fitted with linear, exponential and power laws to look for the function which best represents the trend of the data.  The highest values of Amax are found among K-type stars and at the ages of alpha Persei and Pleiades. We also analyse the activity-rotation connection at the coronal level as well as its dependence on spectral type. The level of X-ray emission increases with increasing rotation rate up to a saturation level. The rotational period at which saturation occurs is colour-dependent and increases with advancing spectral type. Also the LX/Lbol-P and LX/Lbol-R0 relations are fitted with linear, exponential and power laws to look for the best fitting function. Among the fastest rotating stars (P<=0.3 d) there is evidence of super-saturation. Also the highest values of LXLbol are found among K-type stars. Finally, the photospheric-coronal activity connection is investigated by using for the first time the largest ever sample of light curve amplitudes as indicators of the magnetic filling factor. The activity parameters LX/Lbol and Amax are found to be correlated with each other, thus confirming the dependence of coronal activity on photospheric magnetic fields. More precisely, the LX/Lbol-Amax distribution shows the presence of an upper envelope, which is constant at the LX/Lbol  =~ -3.0 saturation level, and of a lower envelope. The best fit to the lower envelope is given by a power law with steepness decreasing from F-G to M spectral types. However, it is considered a tentative result, since the fit reduced chi-squares are large. Such spectral-type dependence may be related to a colour dependence of Amax on the total starspot filling factor, as well as to the coronal emission being possibly more sensitive to starspot activity variations in F- and G-type than in M-type stars. The LX/Lbol-Amax mean values for each cluster in our sample decrease monotonically with increasing age, showing that the levels of photospheric and coronal activity evolve in time according to a single power law till the Sun's age.

@article{spa11,
	Abstract = {We investigate the rotational evolution of solar-like stars with a focus on the internal angular momentum transport processes. The double-zone model, in which the star's radiative core and convective envelope are assumed to rotate as solid bodies, is used to test simple relationships between the core-envelope coupling time-scale, tauc, and rotational properties, like the envelope angular velocity or the differential rotation at the core-envelope interface. The trial relationships are tested by fitting the model parameters to available observations via a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The synthetic distributions are tested for compatibility with their observational counterparts by means of the standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.  A power-law dependence of tauc on the inner differential rotation leads to a more satisfactory agreement with observations than a two-valued prescription for tauc, which would imply a dichotomy between the initially slow (Prot‚{\^a}≥ 3 d) and fast (Prot‚{\^a}≤ 3 d) rotators. However, we find it impossible to reconcile the high fraction of fast rotators in alpha Per with the rotation period distributions in stellar systems at earlier and later evolutionary stages. This could be explained by local environmental effects (e.g. early removal of circumstellar discs due to ultraviolet radiation and winds from nearby high-mass stars) or by observational biases.  The low KS probability that the synthetic and observed distributions are not incompatible, found in some cases, may be due to oversimplified assumptions of the double-zone model, but the large relative uncertainties in the age determination of very young clusters and associations are expected to play a relevant role. Other possible limitations and uncertainties are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We compute the warping of a disc induced by an inclined dipole. We consider a magnetised star surrounded by a thin Keplerian diamagnetic disc with an inner edge that corotates with the star. We suppose the stellar field is a dipole with an axis that is slightly misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. The rotation axes of the disc material orbiting at large distances from the star and that of the star are supposed to coincide. The misalignment of the magnetic and rotation axes results in the magnetic pressure not being the same on the upper and lower surfaces of the disc. The resultant net vertical force produces a warp which appears stationary in a frame corotating with the star. We find that, if viscosity is large enough (alpha ~ 0.01-0.1) to damp bending waves as they propagate away, a smoothly varying warp of the inner region of the disc is produced. The amplitude of the warp can easily be on the order of ten percent of the disc inner radius for reasonably small misalignment angles (less than 30 degrees). Viscous damping also introduces a phase shift between the warp and the forcing torque, which results in the locations of maximum elevation above the disc forming a trailing spiral pattern. We apply these results to recent observations of AA Tau, and show that the variability of its light curve, which occurs with a period comparable to the expected stellar rotation period, could be due to obscuration produced by a warp configuration of the type we obtain.},

As a first application of the complete code, we consider the evolution of Pluto-mass planetesimals in a swarm of 0.1-1 cm pebbles. In a typical evolution time of 1-3 Myr, our calculations transform 0.01-0.1 M sun disks of gas and dust into planetary systems containing super-Earths, Saturns, and Jupiters. Low-mass planets form more often than massive planets; disks with smaller alpha form more massive planets than disks with larger alpha. For Jupiter-mass planets, masses of solid cores are 10-100 M ‚{\"a}{\"\i}.},

	Abstract = {Planetary migration poses a serious challenge to theories of planet formation. In gaseous and planetesimal disks, migration can remove planets as quickly as they form. To explore migration in a planetesimal disk, we combine analytic and numerical approaches. After deriving general analytic migration rates for isolated planets, we use N-body simulations to confirm these results for fast and slow migration modes. Migration rates scale as m -1 (for massive planets) and (1 + (e H/3)3)-1, where m is the mass of a planet and e H is the eccentricity of the background planetesimals in Hill units. When multiple planets stir the disk, our simulations yield the new result that large-scale migration ceases. Thus, growing planets do not migrate through planetesimal disks. To extend these results to migration in gaseous disks, we compare physical interactions and rates. Although migration through a gaseous disk is an important issue for the formation of gas giants, we conclude that migration has little impact on the formation of terrestrial planets.},

	Abstract = {AA Tau has been monitored for more than 20 years since 1987, exhibiting a nearly constant brightness level of V=12.5 mag. We report here that in 2011 it suddenly faded away, becoming 2 magnitudes fainter in the V-band, and has remained in this deep state since then. We report new optical and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy obtained during the fading event. The system appears much redder and fainter than it was in the bright state. Also, the 8.2d photometric period continuously observed for more than 20 years is not seen during most of the deep state. The analysis of the system's brightness and colors suggests that the visual extinction on the line of sight has increased by about 3-4 magnitudes in the deep state. At optical wavelengths, the system appears to be dominated by scattered light, probably originating from the upper surface layers of a highly inclined circumstellar disk. The profiles of the Balmer lines have significantly changed as well, with the disappearance of a central absorption component regularly observed in the bright state. We ascribe this change to the scattering of the system's spectrum by circumstellar dust. Noticeably, the mass accretion rate in the inner disk and onto the central star has not changed as the system faded away. We conclude that the deepening of the AA Tau system is due to a sudden increase of circumstellar dust extinction on the line of sight without concomitant change in the accretion rate. We suggest that the enhanced obscuration may be produced by a non-axisymmetric overdense region in the disk, located at a distance of 7.7 AU or more, that was recently brought on the line of sight by its keplerian motion around the central star.},

	Abstract = {This study aims to determine the impact of stellar binary companions on the lifetime and evolution of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I (Cha I) star-forming region by measuring the frequency and strength of accretion and circumstellar dust signatures around the individual components of T Tauri binary stars. We used high-angular resolution adaptive optics JHKL'-band photometry and 1.5-2.5mu spectroscopy of 19 visual binary and 7 triple stars in Cha I - including one newly discovered tertiary component - with separations between ~25 and ~1000au. The data allowed us to infer stellar component masses and ages and, from the detection of near-infrared excess emission and the strength of Brackett-gamma emission, the presence of ongoing accretion and hot circumstellar dust of the individual stellar component of each binary. Of all the stellar components in close binaries with separations of 25-100au, 10(+15-5)% show signs of accretion. This is less than half of the accretor fraction found in wider binaries, which itself appears significantly reduced (~44%) compared with previous measurements of single stars in Cha I. Hot dust was found around 50(+30-15)% of the target components, a value that is indistinguishable from that of Cha I single stars. Only the closest binaries (<25au) were inferred to have a significantly reduced fraction (<~25%) of components that harbor hot dust. Accretors were exclusively found in binary systems with unequal component masses M_secondary/M_primary < 0.8, implying that the detected accelerated disk dispersal is a function of mass-ratio. This agrees with the finding that only one accreting secondary star was found, which is also the weakest accretor in the sample. The results imply that disk dispersal is more accelerated the stronger the dynamical disk truncation, i.e., the smaller the inferred radius of the disk. (abridged)},

NGC 2264 is one of the nearest and best studied star forming region in the solar neighbourhood, with an estimated age of 3 Myr, and is the object of a recent simultaneous multiband campaign including a new CoRoT observation with the aim to assess the physical origin of the observed variability. We find that the rotational distributions of classical and weak-line T-Tauri stars are different, suggesting a difference in the rotational properties of accreting and non-accreting stars.},

	Abstract = {We present an XMM-Newton survey of the part of Orion A cloud south of the Orion Nebula. This survey includes the Lynds 1641 (L1641) dark cloud, a region of the Orion A cloud with very few massive stars and hence a relatively low ambient UV flux, and the region around the O9 III star Iota Orionis. In addition to proprietary data, we used archival XMM data of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to extend our analysis to a major fraction of the Orion A cloud. We have detected 1060 X-ray sources in L1641 and Iota Ori region. About 94% of the sources have 2MASS & Spitzer counterparts, 204 and 23 being Class II and Class I or protostars objects, respectively. In addition, we have identified 489 X-ray sources as counterparts to Class III candidates, given they are bright in X-rays and appear as normal photospheres at mid-IR wavelengths. The remaining 205 X-ray sources are likely distant AGNs or other galactic sources not related to Orion A. We find that Class III candidates appear more concentrated in two main clusters in L1641. The first cluster of Class III stars is found toward the northern part of L1641, concentrated around Iota Ori. The stars in this cluster are more evolved than those in the Orion Nebula. We estimate a distance of 300-320 pc for this cluster and thus it is closer than the Orion A cloud. Another cluster rich in Class III stars is located in L1641 South and appears to be a slightly older cluster embedded in the Orion A cloud. Furthermore, other evolved Class III stars are found north of the ONC toward NGC 1977.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of an X-ray/UV stellar flare from the source LMC 335, captured by XMM-Newton in the field of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The flare event was recorded continuously in X-ray for its first 10 hr from the precursor to the late decay phases. The observed fluxes increased by more than two orders of magnitude at its peak in X-ray and at least one in the UV as compared to quiescence. The peak 0.1-7.0 keV X-ray flux is derived from the two-temperature APEC model to be ~(8.4 ¬$\pm$ 0.6) √{\'o} 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1. Combining astrometric information from multiple X-ray observations in the quiescent and flare states, we identify the NIR counterpart of LMC 335 as the Two Micron All Sky Survey source J05414534-6921512. The NIR color relations and spectroscopic parallax characterize the source as a Galactic K7-M4 dwarf at a foreground distance of (100-264) pc, implying a total energy output of the entire event of ~(0.4-2.9) √{\'o} 1035 erg. This report comprises detailed analyses of this late-K/early-M dwarf flare event that has the longest time coverage yet reported in the literature. The flare decay can be modeled with two exponential components with timescales of ~28 minutes and ~4 hr, with a single-component decay firmly ruled out. The X-ray spectra during flare can be described by two components, a dominant high-temperature component of ~40-60 MK and a low-temperature component of ~10 MK, with a flare loop length of about 1.1-1.3 stellar radius.},

	Abstract = {We report the serendipitous detection of a giant X-ray flare from the source 2XMM J043527.2-144301 during an XMM-Newton observation of the high latitude molecular cloud MBM20. The source has not been previously studied at any wavelength. The X-ray flux increases by a factor of more than 52 from quiescent state to peak of flare. A 2MASS counterpart has been identified (2MASS J04352724-1443017), and near-infrared colors reveal a spectral type of M8-M8.5 and a distance of (67 ¬$\pm$ 13) pc, placing the source in front of MBM20. Spectral analysis and source luminosity are also consistent with this conclusion. The measured distance makes this object the most distant source (by about a factor of four) at this spectral type detected in X-rays. The X-ray flare was characterized by a peak X-ray luminosity of ~8.2 √{\'o} 1028 erg s-1 and integrated X-ray energy of ~2.3 √{\'o} 1032 erg. The flare emission has been characterized with a two-temperature model with temperatures of ~10 and 46 MK (0.82 and 4.0 keV) and is dominated by the higher temperature component.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study the correlation between the soft (1.6-12.4 keV, mostly thermal) and the hard (20-40 and 60-80 keV, mostly non-thermal) X-ray emission in solar flares up to the most energetic events, spanning about 4 orders of magnitude in peak flux, establishing a general scaling law and extending it to the most intense stellar flaring events observed to date.  Methods: We used the data from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft, a NASA Small Explorer launched in February 2002. RHESSI has good spectral resolution (~=1 keV in the X-ray range) and broad energy coverage (3 keV-20 MeV), which makes it well suited to distinguish the thermal from non-thermal emission in solar flares. Our study is based on the detailed analysis of 45 flares ranging from the GOES C-class, to the strongest X-class events, using the peak photon fluxes in the GOES 1.6-12.4 keV and in two bands selected from RHESSI data, i.e. 20-40 keV and 60-80 keV.  Results: We find a significant correlation between the soft and hard peak X-ray fluxes spanning the complete sample studied. The resulting scaling law has been extrapolated to the case of the most intense stellar flares observed, comparing it with the stellar observations.  Conclusions: Our results show that an extrapolation of the scaling law derived for solar flares to the most active stellar events is compatible with the available observations of intense stellar flares in hard X-rays.},

	Abstract = {Non-degenerate stars of essentially all spectral classes are soft X-ray sources. Their X-ray spectra have been important in constraining physical processes that heat plasma in stellar environments to temperatures exceeding one million degrees. Low-mass stars on the cooler part of the main sequence and their pre-main sequence predecessors define the dominant stellar population in the galaxy by number. Their X-ray spectra are reminiscent, in the broadest sense, of X-ray spectra from the solar corona. The Sun itself as a typical example of a main-sequence cool star has been a pivotal testbed for physical models to be applied to cool stars. X-ray emission from cool stars is indeed ascribed to magnetically trapped hot gas analogous to the solar coronal plasma, although plasma parameters such as temperature, density, and element abundances vary widely. Coronal structure, its thermal stratification and geometric extent can also be interpreted based on various spectral diagnostics. New features have been identified in pre-main sequence stars; some of these may be related to accretion shocks on the stellar surface, fluorescence on circumstellar disks due to X-ray irradiation, or shock heating in stellar outflows. Massive, hot stars clearly dominate the interaction with the galactic interstellar medium: they are the main sources of ionizing radiation, mechanical energy and chemical enrichment in galaxies. High-energy emission permits to probe some of the most important processes at work in these stars, and put constraints on their most peculiar feature: the stellar wind. Medium and high- resolution spectroscopy have shed new light on these objects as well. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of cool and hot stars through the study of X-ray spectra, in particular high-resolution spectra now available from XMM -Newton and Chandra. We address issues related to coronal structure, flares, the composition of coronal plasma, X-ray production in accretion streams and outflows, X-rays from single OB-type stars, massive binaries, magnetic hot objects and evolved WR stars.},

During two nights of observations they observed one significant flare, simultaneously in soft X-rays and visible wavelengths, and one or two smaller bursts. The main flare impulsively heated an area of ‚{\texttrademark}{\"O}2√{\'o}107km2 of the stellar photosphere to a brightness temperature ‚{\texttrademark}{\"U}25000K, during about 5 min, and generated hot plasma, emitting soft X-rays. This emission reached maximum after the impulsive burst and lasted for about an hour; it covered a much larger area on the star than the optical emission. There was no significant hard X-ray component. The authors ascribe the optical continuous emission to the flare's impulsive phase, and the soft X-ray emission to the gradual phase.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous and continuous observations of the Halpha, Hbeta, He I D3, Na I D1, D2 doublet and the Ca II H & K lines for the RS CVn system HR 1099. The spectroscopic observations were obtained during the MUSICOS 1998 campaign involving several observatories and instruments, both echelle and long-slit spectrographs. During this campaign, HR 1099 was observed almost continuously for more than 8 orbits of 2.8 deg. Two large optical flares were observed, both showing an increase in the emission of Halpha, Ca II H & K, Hbeta and He I D3 and a strong filling-in of the Na I D1, D2 doublet. Contemporary photometric observations were carried out with the robotic telescopes APT-80 of Catania and Phoenix-25 of Fairborn Observatories. Maps of the distribution of the spotted regions on the photosphere of the binary components were derived using the Maximum Entropy and Tikhonov photometric regularization criteria. Rotational modulation was observed in Halpha and He I D3 in anti-correlation with the photometric light curves. Both flares occurred at the same binary phase (0.85), suggesting that these events took place in the same active region. Simultaneous X-ray observations, performed by ASM on board RXTE, show several flare-like events, some of which correlate well with the observed optical flares. Rotational modulation in the X-ray light curve has been detected with minimum flux when the less active G5 V star was in front. A possible periodicity in the X-ray flare-like events was also found.

@article{gud04,
	Abstract = {We report results from a comprehensive study of the nearby M dwarf Proxima Centauri with the XMM-Newton satellite, using simultaneously its X-ray detectors and the Optical Monitor with its U band filter. We find strongly variable coronal X-ray emission, with flares ranging over a factor of 100 in peak flux. The low-level emission is found to be continuously variable on at least three time scales (a slow decay of several hours, modulation on a time scale of 1 hr, and weak flares with time scales of a few minutes). Several weak flares are characteristically preceded by an optical burst, compatible with predictions from standard solar flare models. We propose that the U band bursts are proxies for the elusive stellar non-thermal hard X-ray bursts suggested from solar observations. In the course of the observation, a very large X-ray flare started and was observed essentially in its entirety. Its peak luminosity reached 3.9√{\'o} 1028 erg s-1 [0.15-10 keV], and the total X-ray energy released in the same band is derived to be 1.5√{\'o} 1032 ergs. This flare has for the first time allowed to measure significant density variations across several phases of the flare from X-ray spectroscopy of the O VII He-like triplet; we find peak densities reaching up to 4√{\'o} 1011 cm-3 for plasma of about 1-5 MK. Abundance ratios show little variability in time, with a tendency of elements with a high first ionization potential to be overabundant relative to solar photospheric values. Using Fe XVII lines with different oscillator strengths, we do not find significant effects due to opacity during the flare, indicating that large opacity increases are not the rule even in extreme flares. We model the large flare in terms of an analytic 2-Ribbon flare model and find that the flaring loop system should have large characteristic sizes (‚{\^a}{\`a} 1R*) within the framework of this simplistic model. These results are supported by full hydrodynamic simulations. Comparing the large flare to flares of similar size occurring much more frequently on more active stars, we propose that the X-ray properties of active stars are a consequence of superimposed flares such as the example analyzed in this paper. Since larger flares produce hotter plasma, such a model also explains why, during episodes of low-level emission, more active stars show hotter plasma than less active stars.  Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a campaign to observe flares on the M dwarf flare star EV Lacertae over the course of two days in 2001 September, utilizing a combination of radio continuum, optical photometric and spectroscopic, ultraviolet spectroscopic, and X-ray spectroscopic observations to characterize the multiwavelength nature of flares from this active, single, late-type star. We find flares in every wavelength region in which we observed. A large radio flare from the star was observed at both 3.6 and 6 cm and is the most luminous example of a gyrosynchrotron flare yet observed on a dMe flare star. The radio flare can be explained as encompassing a large magnetic volume, comparable to the stellar disk, and involving trapped electrons that decay over timescales of hours. Flux enhancements at 6 cm accompanied by highly negatively circularly polarized emission (pic-->-100%) imply that a coherent emission mechanism is operating in the corona of EV Lac. There are numerous optical white-light flares, and yet no signature of emission-line response from the chromosphere appears. Two small ultraviolet enhancements differ in the amount of nonthermal broadening present. There are numerous X-ray flares occurring throughout the observation, and an analysis of undispersed photons and grating events reveals no evidence for abundance variations. Higher temperatures are present during some flares; however, the maximum temperature achieved varies from flare to flare. There is no evidence for density variations during any flare intervals. In the multiwavelength context, the start of the intense radio flare is coincident with an impulsive optical U-band flare, to within 1 minute, and yet there is no signature of an X-ray response. There are other intervals of time when optical flaring and UV flaring is occurring, but these cannot be related to the contemporaneous X-ray flaring: the time-integrated luminosities do not match the instantaneous X-ray flare luminosity, as one would expect for the Neupert effect. We investigate the probability of chance occurrences of flares from disparate wavelength regions producing temporal coincidences but find that not all the flare associations can be explained by a superposition of flares due to a high flaring rate. We caution against making causal associations of multiwavelength flares based solely on temporal correlations for high flaring rate stars such as EV Lac.},

	Abstract = {The white light during M dwarf flares has long been known to exhibit the broadband shape of a T‚{\^a}{\`a}10 000 K blackbody, and the white light in solar-flares is thought to arise primarily from hydrogen recombination. Yet, a current lack of broad-wavelength coverage solar flare spectra in the optical/near-UV region prohibits a direct comparison of the continuum properties to determine if they are indeed so different. New spectroscopic observations of a secondary flare during the decay of a megaflare on the dM4.5e star YZ CMi have revealed multiple components in the white-light continuum of stellar flares, including both a blackbody-like spectrum and a hydrogen-recombination spectrum. One of the most surprising findings is that these two components are anti-correlated in their temporal evolution. We combine initial phenomenological modeling of the continuum components with spectra from radiative hydrodynamic models to show that continuum veiling causes the measured anti-correlation. This modeling allows us to use the components' inferred properties to predict how a similar spatially resolved, multiple-component, white-light continuum might appear using analogies to several solar-flare phenomena. We also compare the properties of the optical stellar flare white light to Ellerman bombs on the Sun.},

	Abstract = {On UT 2009 January 16, we observed a white light megaflare on the dM4.5e star YZ CMi as part of a long-term spectroscopic flare-monitoring campaign to constrain the spectral shape of optical flare continuum emission. Simultaneous U-band photometric and 3350-9260 √{\"O} spectroscopic observations were obtained during 1.3 hr of the flare decay. The event persisted for more than 7 hr and at flare peak, the U-band flux was almost 6 mag brighter than in the quiescent state. The properties of this flare mark it as one of the most energetic and longest-lasting white light flares ever to be observed on an isolated low-mass star. We present the U-band flare energetics and a flare continuum analysis. For the first time, we show convincingly with spectra that the shape of the blue continuum from 3350 √{\"O} to 4800 √{\"O} can be represented as a sum of two components: a Balmer continuum as predicted by the Allred et al. radiative hydrodynamic flare models and a T~ 10,000 K blackbody emission component as suggested by many previous studies of the broadband colors and spectral distributions of flares. The areal coverage of the Balmer continuum and blackbody emission regions vary during the flare decay, with the Balmer continuum emitting region always being significantly (~3-16 times) larger. These data will provide critical constraints for understanding the physics underlying the mysterious blue continuum radiation in stellar flares.  Based on observations obtained with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m Telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

	Abstract = {We show that V410 Tau, a weak-line T Tauri star, is a flaring star. This result comes from an intensive, coordinated monitoring campaign carried out in November 2001 at visible and X-ray wavelength ranges. It is confirmed by previous, isolated observations found in the literature. Flares tend to occur mainly around the star's minimum brightness, when the most active regions face us. We report on the strongest flare detected up to now on this star, for which we have obtained simultaneous visible Str√∂mgren photometry and intermediate resolution spectroscopy. We derive decay times from 3 to 0.7 h at several wavelengths for the continuum in the 3600-5600 √{\"O} range. We estimate the energy involved in this and the other flares for which we have good time sampling, and conclude that the strongest event, at least, could have important consequences for the matter in the surroundings of the star. If similar events took place on the young Sun and lasted for several Myr, they could explain the anomalous abundances of elemental isotopes found in some meteorites. They could have also contributed to eliminate part of the primary atmospheres of the planet embryos and would have provided enough energy for the melting of solid iron-magnesium silicates, a process that may explain the presence of chondrules in chondritic meteorites. High resolution spectroscopy of the Halpha emission line in the quiescent states of V410 Tau enables us to study the variability of the broad component. We suggest that this component is related to microflaring activity, such as the one observed on more evolved, magnetically-active stars. The large velocities and the energy associated with this component support this hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Water is key in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of comets and icy/water planets. While high excitation water lines originating in the hot inner disk have been detected in several T Tauri stars (TTSs), water vapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, was only reported in the closeby TTS TW Hya. We present spectrally resolved Herschel/HIFI observations of the young TTS DG Tau in the ortho- and para- water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 GHz. The lines show a narrow double-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are ~19-26 times brighter than in TW Hya. In contrast, CO and [C II] lines are dominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes H2O lines a unique tracer of the disk of DG Tau. Disk modeling with the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo indicates that the strong UV field, due to the young age and strong accretion of DG Tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 AU from the star, heating it up to temperatures of 600 K and producing the observed bright water lines. The models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 Msun, consistent with the estimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a water reservoir of ~1e2-1e3 Earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the form of ice. Hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery on terrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of a database of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated flares over the period 1996-2007 finds well-behaved power law relationships between the 1-8 AA flare X-ray fluence and CME mass and kinetic energy. We extrapolate these relationships to lower and higher flare energies to estimate the mass and energy loss due to CMEs from stellar coronae, assuming that the observed X-ray emission of the latter is dominated by flares with a frequency as a function of energy dn/dE=kE^-alpha. For solar-like stars at saturated levels of X-ray activity, the implied losses depend fairly weakly on the assumed value of alpha and are very large: M_dot ~ 5x10^-10 M_sun/yr and E_dot ~ 0.1L_sun. In order to avoid such large energy requirements, either the relationships between CME mass and speed and flare energy must flatten for X-ray fluence >~ 10^31 erg, or the flare-CME association must drop significantly below 1 for more energetic events. If active coronae are dominated by flares, then the total coronal energy budget is likely to be up to an order of magnitude larger than the canonical 10^-3 L_bol X-ray saturation threshold. This raises the question of what is the maximum energy a magnetic dynamo can extract from a star? For an energy budget of 1% of L_bol, the CME mass loss rate is about 5x10^-11 M_sun/yr.},

	Abstract = {To explore young star variability on a large range of timescales, we have used the MOST satellite to obtain 24 days of continuous, sub-minute cadence, high-precision optical photometry on a field of classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars (TTS) in the Taurus-Auriga star formation complex. Observations of AB Aurigae, SU Aurigae, V396 Aurigae, V397 Aurigae, and HD 31305 reveal brightness fluctuations at the 1-10% level on timescales of hours to weeks. We have further assessed the variability properties with Fourier, wavelet, and autocorrelation techniques, identifying one significant period per star. We present spot models in an attempt to fit the periodicities, but find that we cannot fully account for the observed variability. Rather, all stars exhibit a mixture of periodic and aperiodic behavior, with the latter dominating stochastically on timescales less than several days. After removal of the main periodicity, periodograms for each light curve display power law trends consistent with those seen for other young accreting stars. Several of our targets exhibited unusual variability patterns not anticipated by prior studies, and we propose that this behavior originates with the circumstellar disks. The MOST observations underscore the need for investigation of TTS light variations on a wide range of timescales in order to elucidate the physical processes responsible; we provide guidelines for future time series observations.},

	Abstract = {AK~Sco stands out among pre-main sequence binaries because of its prominent ultraviolet excess, the high eccentricity of its orbit and the strong tides driven by it. AK Sco consists of two F5 type stars that get as close as 11R$_*$ at periastron passage. The presence of a dense ($n_e \sim 10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$) extended envelope has been unveiled recently. In this article, we report the results from a XMM-Newton based monitoring of the system. We show that at periastron, X-ray and UV fluxes are enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3$ with respect to the apastron values. The X-ray radiation is produced in an optically thin plasma with T$\sim 6.4\times 10^{6}$ K and it is found that the N$_H$ column density rises from 0.35$\times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at periastron to 1.11$\times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at apastron, in good agreement with previous polarimetric observations. The UV emission detected in the Optical Monitor band seems to be caused by the reprocessing of the high energy magnetospheric radiation on the circumstellar material. Further evidence of the strong magnetospheric disturbances is provided by the detection of line broadening of 278.7~km~s$^{-1}$ in the N~V line with HST/STIS. Numerical simulations of the mass flow from the circumbinary disk to the components have been carried out. They provide a consistent scenario with which to interpret AK~Sco observations. We show that the eccentric orbit acts like a gravitational piston. At apastron, matter is dragged efficiently from the inner disk border, filling the inner gap and producing accretion streams that end as ring-like structures around each component of the system. At periastron, the ring-like structures come into contact, leading to angular momentum loss, and thus producing an accretion outburst.},

	Abstract = {Periodic increases in luminosity arising from variable accretion rates have been predicted for some pre-main-sequence close binary stars as they grow from circumbinary disks. The phenomenon is known as pulsed accretion and can affect the orbital evolution and mass distribution of young binaries, as well as the potential for planet formation. Accretion variability is a common feature of young stars, with a large range of amplitudes and timescales as measured from multi-epoch observations at optical and infrared wavelengths. Periodic variations consistent with pulsed accretion have been seen in only a few young binaries via optical accretion tracers, albeit intermittently with accretion luminosity variations ranging from zero to 50 per cent from orbit to orbit. Here we report that the infrared luminosity of a young protostar (of age about 105 years) increases by a factor of ten in roughly one week every 25.34days. We attribute this to pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The strength and regularity of this accretion signal is surprising; it may be related to the very young age of the system, which is a factor of ten younger than the other pulsed accretors previously studied.},

	Abstract = {The impact of radiation pressure on the dynamics of the gas in the vicinity of young stellar clusters is thoroughly discussed. The radiation over the thermal/ram pressure ratio time evolution is calculated explicitely and the crucial role of the cluster mechanical power and of the strong time evolution of the ionizing photon flux and of the bolometric luminosity of the exciting cluster is stressed. It is shown that radiation has only a narrow window of opportunity to dominate the wind-driven shell dynamics. This may occur only at early stages of the bubble evolution and if the shell expands into a dusty and/or a very dense proto-cluster medium. The impact of radiation pressure on the wind-driven shell becomes always negligible after about 3 Myr. Finally, the wind-driven model results allow one to compare the model predictions with the distribution of thermal pressure derived from X-ray observations. The shape of the thermal pressure profile allows then to distinguish between the energy and the momentum dominated regimes of expansion and thus conclude whether radiative losses of energy or the leakage of hot gas from the bubble interior have been significant during the bubble evolution.},

	Abstract = {We study the influence of the spatial resolution on scales of $5\deg$ and smaller of solar surface magnetic field maps on global magnetohydrodynamic solar wind models, and on a model of coronal heating and X-ray emission. We compare the solutions driven by a low-resolution Wilcox Solar Observatory magnetic map, the same map with spatial resolution artificially increased by a refinement algorithm, and a high-resolution Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson Doppler Imager map. We find that both the wind structure and the X-ray morphology are affected by the fine-scale surface magnetic structure. Moreover, the X-ray morphology is dominated by the closed loop structure between mixed polarities on smaller scales and shows significant changes between high and low resolution maps. We conclude that three-dimensional modeling of coronal X-ray emission has greater surface magnetic field spatial resolution requirements than wind modeling, and can be unreliable unless the dominant mixed polarity magnetic flux is properly resolved.},

	Abstract = {We test analytic predictions from different models of magnetospheric accretion, which invoke disk-locking, using stellar and accretion parameters derived from models of low-resolution optical spectra of 36 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in NGC 2264 (age ~3 Myr). Little evidence is found for models that assume purely dipolar field geometries; however, strong support is found in the data for a modified version of the X-wind model which allows for non-dipolar field geometries. The trapped flux concept in the X-wind model is key to making the analytic predictions which appear supported in the data. By extension, our analysis provides support for the outflows predicted by the X-wind as these also originate in the trapped flux region. In addition, we find no support in the data for accretion-powered stellar winds from young stars. By comparing the analysis presented here of NGC 2264 with a similar analysis of stars in Taurus (age ~1-2 Myr), we find evidence that the equilibrium interaction between the magnetic field and accretion disk in TTS systems evolves as the stars grow older, perhaps as the result of evolution of the stellar magnetic field geometry. We compare the accretion rates we derive with accretion rates based on U-band excess, finding good agreement. In addition, we use our accretion parameters to determine the relationship between accretion and Hbeta luminosity, again finding good agreement with previously published results; however, we also find that care must be taken when applying this relationship due to strong chromospheric emission in young stars, which can lead to erroneous results in some cases.},

	Abstract = {We present preliminary results of our X-shooter survey in star forming regions. In this contribution we focus on sub-samples of young stellar and sub-stellar objects (YSOs) in the Lupus star forming region and in the TW Hya association. We show that the X-shooter spectra are suitable for conducting several parallel studies such as YSO + disk fundamental parameters, accretion and outflow activity in the very low-mass (VLM) and sub-stellar regimes, as well as magnetic activity in young VLM YSOs, and Li abundance determinations. The capabilities of X-shooter in terms of wide spectral coverage, resolution and limiting magnitudes, allow us to assess simultaneously the accretion/outflow, magnetic activity, and disk diagnostics, from the UV and optical to the near-IR, avoiding ambiguities due to possible YSO variability.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under Programmes 084.C-0269 and 085.C-0238.},

	Abstract = {Context. The first million years of the pre-main-sequence (PMS) evolution of low-mass stars are characterized by magnetospheric accretion, a circumstellar proto-planetary disk, and the processes leading to its dispersal. Among these, photo-evaporation caused by strong X-ray emission from the central star is probably significant. Several aspects of the X-ray emission from coronae and accretion shocks remain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronal emission.  Aims: We studied the X-ray variability of ~1 Myr old low-mass PMS stars as a function of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics to gain insights into the working of PMS coronae, their X-ray emission, and the circumstellar environment in which they are immersed.  Methods: We have exploited the ~850 ks long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained by the COUP collaboration in January 2003, and statistically analyzed the X-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. Our main focus was to characterize the different X-ray behavior of stars with and without circumstellar accretion disks, and to infer the physical mechanism responsible for the observed variability.  Results: Accreting stars (classical T Tauri stars, CTTSs) are found to be more variable than non-accreting stars (weak-line T Tauri stars, WTTSs) at all timescales and in all X-ray energy bands considered. Variability is seen to increase with timescale, up to the longest probed, ~10 days. Signatures of rotational modulation are observed for both CTTSs and WTTSs, and most clearly for CTTSs in the soft X-ray band. Lower mass stars are more variable than higher mass stars.  Conclusions: We propose that the difference in variability between CTTSs and WTTSs may be explained assuming that the X-ray emission of CTTS is affected by time-variable absorption due to circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/or accretion streams. This suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis that the coronae of CTTSs and WTTSs are similar, it may also explain why CTTSs have lower and more scattered X-ray emission levels compared to WTTSs.

	Abstract = {We present a new census of the Orion Nebula Cluster over a large field of view (gsim 30' √{\'o} 30'), significantly increasing the known population of stellar and substellar cluster members with precisely determined properties. We develop and exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures from optical colors, nearly doubling the previously available number of objects with effective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster. Our technique utilizes colors from deep photometry in the I band and in two medium-band filters at lambda ~ 753 and 770 nm, which accurately measure the depth of a molecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. From these colors we can derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better than one-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of the extinction to the individual stars. Also, because this technique utilizes only photometry redward of 750 nm, the results are only mildly sensitive to optical veiling produced by accretion. Completing our census with previously available data, we place some 1750 sources in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and assign masses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses. At faint luminosities, we detect a large population of background sources which is easily separated in our photometry from the bona fide cluster members. The resulting initial mass function of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar mass range, and we find that it declines steeply with decreasing mass. This suggests a deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to the Galactic disk population.},

	Abstract = {Diagnostics of electron temperature (Te ), electron density (ne ), and hydrogen column density (N H) from the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating spectrum of He-like Ne IX in TW Hydrae (TW Hya), in conjunction with a classical accretion model, allow us to infer the accretion rate onto the star directly from measurements of the accreting material. The new method introduces the use of the absorption of Ne IX lines as a measure of the column density of the intervening, accreting material. On average, the derived mass accretion rate for TW Hya is 1.5 √{\'o} 10--9 M ‚{\`o}{\^a} yr--1, for a stellar magnetic field strength of 600 G and a filling factor of 3.5%. Three individual Chandra exposures show statistically significant differences in the Ne IX line ratios, indicating changes in N H, Te , and ne by factors of 0.28, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In exposures separated by 2.7 days, the observations reported here suggest a five-fold reduction in the accretion rate. This powerful new technique promises to substantially improve our understanding of the accretion process in young stars.},

	Abstract = {We use the IRAM 30-m telescope to perform a sensitive search for CN N=2-1 in 42 T Tauri or Herbig Ae systems located mostly in the Taurus-Auriga region. $^{13}$CO J=2-1 is observed simultaneously to indicate the level of confusion with the surrounding molecular cloud. The bandpass also contains two transitions of ortho-H$_2$CO, one of SO and the C$^{17}$O J=2-1 line which provide complementary information on the nature of the emission. While $^{13}$CO is in general dominated by residual emission from the cloud, CN exhibits a high disk detection rate $> 50$% in our sample. We even report CN detection in stars for which interferometric searches failed to detect $^{12}$CO, presumably because of obscuration by a foreground, optically thick, cloud. Comparison between CN and o-H$_2$CO or SO line profiles and intensities divide the sample in two main categories. Sources with SO emission are bright and have strong H$_2$CO emission, leading in general to [H$_2$CO/CN]$ > 0.5$. Furthermore, their line profiles, combined with a priori information on the objects, suggest that the emission is coming from outflows or envelopes rather than from a circumstellar disk. On the other hand, most sources have [H$_2$CO/CN]$ < 0.3$, no SO emission, and some of them exhibit clear double-peaked profiles characteristics of rotating disks. In this second category, CN is likely tracing the proto-planetary disks. From the line flux and opacity derived from the hyperfine ratios, we constrain the outer radii of the disks, which range from 300 to 600 AU. The overall gas disk detection rate (including all molecular tracers) is $\sim 68%$, and decreases for fainter continuum sources. This study shows that gas disks, like dust disks, are ubiquitous around young PMS stars in regions of isolated star formation, and that a large fraction of them have $R > 300$ AU.},

	Abstract = {Mid-infrared atomic and ionic line ratios measured in spectra of pre-main-sequence stars are sensitive indicators of the hardness of the radiation field impinging on the disk surface. We present a low-resolution Spitzer IRS search for [Ar II] at 6.98 mum, [Ne II] at 12.81 mum, and [Ne III] 15.55 mum lines in 56 transitional disks. These objects, characterized by reduced near-infrared but strong far-infrared excess emission, are ideal targets to set constraints on the stellar radiation field onto the disk, because their spectra are not contaminated by shock emission from jets/outflows or by molecular emission lines. After demonstrating that we can detect [Ne II] lines and recover their fluxes from the low-resolution spectra, here we report the first detections of [Ar II] lines toward protoplanetary disks. We did not detect [Ne III] emission in any of our sources. Our [Ne II]/[Ne III] line flux ratios combined with literature data suggest that a soft-EUV or X-ray spectrum produces these gas lines. Furthermore, the [Ar II]/[Ne II] line flux ratios point to a soft X-ray and/or soft-EUV stellar spectrum as the ionization source of the [Ar II] and [Ne II] emitting layer of the disk. If the soft X-ray component dominates over the EUV, then we would expect larger photoevaporation rates and, hence, a reduction of the time available to form planets.},

	Abstract = {Young stars surrounded by disks with very low mass accretion rates are likely in the final stages of inner disk evolution and therefore particularly interesting to study. We present ultraviolet (UV) observations of the ~5-9 Myr old stars RECX-1 and RECX-11, obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations. The two stars have similar levels of near-UV emission, although spectroscopic evidence indicates that RECX-11 is accreting and RECX-1 is not. The line profiles of Halpha and He I lambda10830 in RECX-11 show both broad and narrow redshifted absorption components that vary with time, revealing the complexity of the accretion flows. We show that accretion indicators commonly used to measure mass accretion rates, e.g., U-band excess luminosity or the Ca II triplet line luminosity, are unreliable for low accretors, at least in the middle K spectral range. Using RECX-1 as a template for the intrinsic level of photospheric and chromospheric emission, we determine an upper limit of 3 √{\'o} 10-10 M &sun; yr-1 for RECX-11. At this low accretion rate, recent photoevaporation models predict that an inner hole should have developed in the disk. However, the spectral energy distribution of RECX-11 shows fluxes comparable to the median of Taurus in the near-infrared, indicating that substantial dust remains. Fluorescent H2 emission lines formed in the innermost disk are observed in RECX-11, showing that gas is present in the inner disk, along with the dust.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We present an Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel far-ultraviolet (FUV) study of H2 gas in 12 weak T Tauri stars in nearby star-forming regions. The sample consists of sources which have no evidence of inner disk dust. Our new FUV spectra show that in addition to the dust, the gas is depleted from the inner disk. This sample is combined with a larger FUV sample of accretors and non-accretors with ages between 1 and 100 Myr, showing that as early as 1-3 Myr, systems both with and without gas are found. Possible mechanisms for depleting gas quickly include viscous evolution, planet formation, and photoevaporation by stellar radiation fields. Since these mechanisms alone cannot account for the lack of gas at 1-3 Myr, it is likely that the initial conditions (e.g., initial disk mass or core angular momentum) contribute to the variety of disks observed at any age. We estimate the angular momentum of a cloud needed for most of the mass to fall very close to the central object and compare this to models of the expected distribution of angular momenta. Up to 20% of cloud cores have low enough angular momenta to form disks with the mass close to the star, which would then accrete quickly; this percentage is similar to the fraction of diskless stars in the youngest star-forming regions. With our sample, we characterize the chromospheric contribution to the FUV luminosity and find that L FUV/L bol saturates at ~10-4.1.},

	Abstract = {High-energy radiation from T Tauri stars (TTS) influences the amount and longevity of gas in disks, thereby playing a crucial role in the creation of gas giant planets. Here we probe the high-energy ionizing radiation from TTS using high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) Spitzer IRS Neon forbidden line detections in a sample of disks from IC 348, NGC 2068, and Chamaeleon. We report three new detections of [Ne III] from CS Cha, SZ Cha, and T 54, doubling the known number of [Ne III] detections from TTS. Using [Ne III]-to-[Ne II] ratios in conjunction with X-ray emission measurements, we probe high-energy radiation from TTS. The majority of previously inferred [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratios based on [Ne III] line upper limits are significantly less than 1, pointing to the dominance of either X-ray radiation or soft Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) radiation in producing these lines. Here we report the first observational evidence for hard EUV dominated Ne forbidden line production in a T Tauri disk: [Ne III]/[Ne II]~1 in SZ Cha. Our results provide a unique insight into the EUV emission from TTS, by suggesting that EUV radiation may dominate the creation of Ne forbidden lines, albeit in a minority of cases.},

	Abstract = {We present two main results, based on models and the statistical analyses of 1672 U-band flares. We also discuss the behaviour of white-light flares. In addition, the parameters of the flares detected from two years of observations on CR Dra are presented. By comparing with flare parameters obtained from other UV Ceti-type stars, we examine the behaviour of the optical flare processes along with the spectral types. Moreover, we aimed, using large white-light flare data, to analyse the flare time-scales with respect to some results obtained from X-ray observations. Using SPSS V17.0 and GraphPad Prism V5.02 software, the flares detected from CR Dra were modelled with the OPEA function, and analysed with the t-Test method to compare similar flare events in other stars. In addition, using some regression calculations in order to derive the best histograms, the time-scales of white-light flares were analysed. Firstly, CR Dra flares have revealed that white-light flares behave in a similar way as their counterparts observed in X-rays. As can be seen in X-ray observations, the electron density seems to be a dominant parameter in white-light flare process, too. Secondly, the distributions of the flare time-scales demonstrate that the number of observed flares reaches a maximum value in some particular ratios, which are 0.5, or its multiples, and especially positive integers. The thermal processes might be dominant for these white-light flares, while non-thermal processes might be dominant in the others. To obtain better results for the behaviour of the white-light flare process along with the spectral types, much more stars in a wide spectral range, from spectral type dK5e to dM6e, must be observed in white-light flare patrols.},

	Abstract = {We present period measurements of a large sample of field stars in the solar neighbourhood, observed by the COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) satellite in two different directions of the Galaxy. The presence of a period was detected using the Lomb-Scargle normalized periodogram technique and the autocorrelation analysis. The assessment of the results has been performed through a consistency verification supported by the folded light-curve analysis. The data analysis procedure has discarded a non-negligible fraction of light curves due to instrumental artefacts; however, it has allowed us to identify pulsators and binaries among a large number of field stars. We measure a wide range of periods, from 0.25 to 100 d, most of which are rotation periods.  The final catalogue includes 1978 periods, with 1727 of them identified as rotational periods, 169 as pulsations and 82 as orbital periods of binary systems. Our sample suffers from selection biases not easily corrected for; thus, we do not use the distribution of rotation periods to derive the age distribution of the main-sequence population. Nevertheless, using rotation as a proxy for age, we can identify a sample of young stars (<=600 Myr) that will constitute a valuable sample, supported by further spectroscopic observations, to study the recent star formation history in the solar neighbourhood. The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {We combine extinction maps from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) with Hipparcos and Tycho parallaxes to obtain reliable and high-precision estimates of the distance to the Ophiuchus and Lupus dark complexes. Our analysis, based on a rigorous maximum-likelihood approach, shows that the rho-Ophiuchi cloud is located at (119 $\pm$ 6) pc and the Lupus complex is located at (155 $\pm$ 8) pc; in addition, we are able to put constraints on the thickness of the clouds and on their orientation on the sky (both these effects are not included in the error estimate quoted above). For Ophiuchus, we find some evidence that the streamers are closer to us than the core. The method applied in this paper is currently limited to nearby molecular clouds, but it will find many natural applications in the GAIA-era, when it will be possible to pin down the distance and three-dimensional structure of virtually every molecular cloud in the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {This is a draft chapter for a book, entitled Physical Processes in Circumstellar Disks around Young Stars, which is scheduled for publication by the University of Chicago Press as one of its Theoretical Astrophysics Series volumes. Sect. 1 presents the motivation for considering the effects of a large-scale, ordered magnetic field on the formation and evolution of protostellar disks. Sect. 2 outlines the physical principles that underlie the magnetohydrodynamics of disks that are threaded by such a field. Sect. 3 discusses the formation and early evolution of disks that result from the collapse of a rotating molecular cloud core that is coupled to the insterstellar magnetic field. Sect. 4 reviews the observational evidence for the disk--wind connection and describes the structure of magnetically accelerated disk outflows, focusing on centrifugally driven winds; it then goes on to discuss the equilibrium and stability properties of weakly ionized protostellar accretion disks in which the transport of angular momentum is dominated by a wind of this type. Sect. 5 considers the coupling between the central protostar and the surrounding disk through the protostellar magnetic field, covering, in turn, the phenomenology, basic concepts, and results of numerical simulations. The chapter is summarized in Sect. 6, which also contains a discussion of future research directions.},

	Abstract = {We have performed hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations of a photoevaporating disc around a Herbig Ae/Be star to determine the evolution and observational impact of dust entrained in the wind. We find that the wind selectively entrains grains of different sizes at different radii resulting in a dust population that varies spatially and increases with height above the disc at radii >10 au. This variable grain population results in a `wingnut' morphology to the dust density distribution. We calculate images of this dust distribution at near-infrared wavelengths that also show a `wingnut' morphology at all wavelengths considered. We have also considered the contribution that crystalline dust grains will have in the wind and show that photoevaporative wind can result in a significant crystallinity fraction at all radii, when the disc is edge-on. However, when the disc's photosphere is unobscured, the photoevaporative wind makes no contribution to the observable crystallinity fraction in the disc. Finally, we conclude that the analysis of extended emission around edge-on discs could provide a new and independent method of testing photoevaporation models.},

	Abstract = {We explore the role of X-ray photoevaporation in the evolution and dispersal of viscously evolving T Tauri discs. We show that the X-ray photoevaporation wind rates scale linearly with X-ray luminosity, such that the observed range of X-ray luminosities for solar-type T Tauri stars (1028-1031 erg s-1) gives rise to vigorous disc winds with rates of the order of 10-10 to 10-7 M&sun; yr-1. These mass-loss rates are comparable to typically observed T Tauri accretion rates, immediately demonstrating the relevance of X-ray photoevaporation to disc evolution. We use the wind solutions from radiation-hydrodynamic models, coupled to a viscous evolution model, to construct a population synthesis model so that we may study the physical properties of evolving discs and so-called 'transition discs'. Current observations of disc lifetimes and accretion rates can be matched by our model assuming a viscosity parameter alpha= 2.5 × 10-3. Our models confirm that X-rays play a dominant role in the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs giving rise to the observed diverse population of inner-hole 'transition' sources which include those with massive outer discs, those with gas in their inner holes and those with detectable accretion signatures. To help understand the nature of observed transition discs we present a diagnostic diagram based on accretion rates versus inner-hole sizes that demonstrate that, contrary to recent claims, many of the observed accreting and non-accreting transition discs can easily be explained by X-ray photoevaporation. However, we draw attention to a smaller but still significant population of strongly accreting (˜10-8 M&sun; yr-1) transition discs with large inner holes (>20 au) that lie outside the predicted X-ray photoevaporation region, suggesting a different origin for their inner holes. Finally, we confirm the conjecture of Drake et al. that accretion is suppressed by the X-rays through 'photoevaporation-starved accretion' and predict that this effect can give rise to a negative correlation between X-ray luminosity and accretion rate, as reported in the Orion data. We also demonstrate that our model can replicate the observed difference in X-ray properties between accreting and non-accreting T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We present new lambda7 mm continuum observations of Orion BN/KL with the Very Large Array. We resolve the emission from the young stellar objects radio Source I and BN at several epochs. Radio Source I is highly elongated northwest-southeast, and remarkably stable in flux density, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This favors the extended emission component arising from an ionized edge-on disk rather than an outwardly propagating jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first time at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and 26 km s-1, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously inferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios that can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of disks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close (~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I and BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter, we argue that Source I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20 M sun and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close encounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though truncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show that the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 M sun total mass (Source I) and a single star of 10 M sun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary hardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large enough to power the wide-angle, high-velocity flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL nebula. Assuming that the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass for Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (gsim7 M sun) by Matthews et al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g., magnetic) must play an important role in the circumstellar gas dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We report here the first results of a multiwavelength campaign focussing on magnetospheric accretion processes of the classical T Tauri star V2129 Oph. In this paper, we present spectropolarimetric observations collected in 2009 July with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and contemporaneous photometry secured with the SMARTS facility. Circularly polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected, both in photospheric absorption and accretion-powered emission lines, from time-series of which we reconstruct new maps of the magnetic field, photospheric brightness and accretion-powered emission at the surface of V2129 Oph using our newest tomographic imaging tool - to be compared with those derived from our old 2005 June data set, re-analysed in the exact same way. We find that in 2009 July, V2129 Oph hosts octupolar and dipolar field components of about 2.1 and 0.9 kG, respectively, both tilted by about 20$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the rotation axis; we conclude that the large-scale magnetic topology changed significantly since 2005 June (when the octupole and dipole components were about 1.5 and three times weaker, respectively), demonstrating that the field of V2129 Oph is generated by a non-stationary dynamo. We also show that V2129 Oph features a dark photospheric spot and a localized area of accretion-powered emission, both close to the main surface magnetic region (hosting fields of up to about 4 kG in 2009 July). We finally obtain that the surface shear of V2129 Oph is about half as strong as solar. From the fluxes of accretion-powered emission lines, we estimate that the observed average logarithmic accretion rate (in M&sun; yr-1) at the surface of V2129 Oph is -9.2 $\pm$ 0.3 at both epochs, peaking at -9.0 at magnetic maximum. It implies in particular that the radius at which the magnetic field of V2129 Oph truncates the inner accretion disc is 0.93 and 0.50 times the corotation radius (where the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation period) in 2009 July and 2005 June, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Existing stellar X-ray surveys suggest major problems in our understanding of the evolution of stellar magnetic activity in solar and late-type stars, reaching conflicting conclusions over the rate of decay of X-ray activity and the spectral types responsible. We are confronting these discrepancies with a new model of the expected stellar X-ray luminosity distribution, combining a Galactic population synthesis model with current theories for rotational spin- down and the rotation -- activity relation for the stellar magnetic dynamo. Here we test our model using new observations of the stellar content of the Chandra COSMOS survey, for which 60 new stellar X-ray sources are identified from the thin disk and Galactic halo populations. Our model is in approximate agreement with the observed X-ray luminosity distribution and the distribution of spectral types responsible. However, slight differences in the form of the X-ray luminosity distribution exist that may hint at problems in our understanding of stellar X-ray emission.},

	Abstract = {We present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new FU Orionis-like young stellar object PTF 10qpf (also known as LkHalpha 188-G4 and HBC 722). Prior to this outburst, LkHalpha 188-G4 was classified as a classical T Tauri star (CTTS) on the basis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a K8-type photosphere and its photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index of LkHalpha 188-G4 indicates a Class II-type object. LkHalpha 188-G4 exhibited a steady rise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in August 2009, before a subsequent more abrupt rise of >3 mag on a timescale of ~2 months. Observations taken during the eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (1) an increase in brightness by gsim4 mag, (2) a bright optical/near-infrared reflection nebula appeared, (3) optical spectra are consistent with a G supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being Halpha which is characterized by a P Cygni profile, (4) near-infrared spectra resemble those of late K-M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in the molecular bands of CO and H2O, and (5) outflow signatures in H and He are seen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. LkHalpha 188-G4 is the first member of the FU Orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. The association of the PTF 10qpf outburst with the previously identified CTTS LkHalpha 188-G4 (HBC 722) provides strong evidence that FU Orionis-like eruptions represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered by instabilities in the disk. The early identification of PTF 10qpf as an FU Orionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopic observations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other known outbursting objects.},

	Abstract = {Context. Recent observations of the low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS), eccentric spectroscopic binaries DQ Tau and V773 Tau A reveal that their millimeter spectrum is occasionally dominated by flares from non-thermal emission processes. The transient activity is believed to be synchrotron in nature, resulting from powerful magnetic reconnection events when the separate magnetic structures of the binary components are briefly capable of interacting and forced to reorganize, typically near periastron. Aims: We conducted the first systematic study of the millimeter variability toward a sample of 12 PMS spectroscopic binaries with the aim to characterize the proliferation of flares amongst sources likely to experience similar interbinary reconnection events. The source sample consists entirely of short-period, close-separation binaries that possess either a high orbital eccentricity (e > 0.1) or a circular orbit (e ≈ 0). Methods: Using the MAMBO2 array on the IRAM 30 m telescope, we carried out continuous monitoring at 1.25 mm (240 GHz) over a 4-night period during which all of the high-eccentricity binaries approached periastron. We also obtained simultaneous optical VRI measurements, since a strong link is often observed between stellar reconnection events (traced via X-rays) and optical brightenings. Results: UZ Tau E is the only source to be detected at millimeter wavelengths, and it exhibited significant variation (F1.25mm = 87-179 mJy); it is also the only source to undergo strong simultaneous optical variability (DeltaR ≈ 0.9 mag). The binary possesses the largest orbital eccentricity in the current sample, a predicted factor in star-star magnetic interaction events. With orbital parameters and variable accretion activity similar to DQ Tau, the millimeter behavior of UZ Tau E draws many parallels to the DQ Tau model for colliding magnetospheres. However, on the basis of our observations alone, we cannot determine whether the variability is repetitive, or if it could also be due to variable free-free emission in an ionized wind. Conclusions: UZ Tau E brings the number of known millimeter-varying PMS sources to 3 out of a total of 14 monitored binaries now in the literature. Important factors in the non-detection of the rest of our targets are the coarse time-sampling and limited millimeter sensitivity of our survey. We recommend that future studies concentrate on close-by targets, and obtain millimeter and optical data points with better temporal resolution.

	Abstract = {Observations of the Sun and of Sun-like stars provide access to different aspects of stellar magnetic activity that, when combined, help us piece together a more comprehensive picture than can be achieved from only the solar or the stellar perspective. Where the Sun provides us with decent spatial resolution of, e.g., magnetic bipoles and the overlying dynamic, hot atmosphere, the ensemble of stars enables us to see rare events on at least some occasions. Where the Sun shows us how flux emergence, dispersal, and disappearance occur in the complex mix of polarities on the surface, only stellar observations can show us the activity of the ancient or future Sun. In this review, I focus on a comparison of statistical properties, from bipolar-region emergence to flare energies, and from heliospheric events to solar energetic particle impacts on Earth. In doing so, I point out some intriguing correspondences as well as areas where our knowledge falls short of reaching unambiguous conclusions on, for example, the most extreme space-weather events that we can expect from the present-day Sun. The difficulties of interpreting stellar coronal light curves in terms of energetic events are illustrated with some examples provided by the SDO, STEREO, and GOES spacecraft.},

	Abstract = {Context. Our knowledge of circumstellar disks has traditionally been based on studies of dust. However, gas dominates the disk mass and its study is key to our understanding of accretion, outflows, and ultimately planet formation. The Spitzer Space Telescope provides access to gas emission lines in the mid-infrared, providing crucial new diagnostics of the physical conditions in accretion disks and outflows. Aims: We seek to identify gas emission lines in mid-infrared spectra of 64 pre-main-sequence stars in Taurus. Using line luminosities and other known star-disk-outflow parameters, we aim to identify correlations that will help to constrain gas heating, excitation mechanisms, and the line formation. Methods: We have based our study on Spitzer observations using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), mainly with the high-resolution modules. Line luminosities (or 3sigma upper limits) have been obtained by fitting Gaussian profiles to the lines. We have further searched for correlations between the line luminosities and different parameters related to the star-disk system. Results: We have detected H2 (17.03, 28.22 mum) emission in 6 objects, [Ne II] (12.81 mum) emission in 18 objects, and [Fe II] (17.93, 25.99 mum) emission in 7 objects. [Ne II] detections are found primarily in Class II objects. The luminosity of the [Ne II] line (LNeII) is in general higher for objects known to drive jets than for those without known jets, but the two groups are not statistically distinguishable. LNeII is correlated with X-ray luminosity, but for Class II objects only. LNeII is also correlated with disk mass and accretion rate when the sample is divided into high and low accretors. Furthermore, we find correlations of LNeII with mid-IR continuum luminosity and with luminosity of the [O I] (6300 {\AA}) line, the latter being an outflow tracer. L [FeII] correlates with Macc. No correlations were found between LH2 and several tested parameters. Conclusions: Our study reveals a general trend toward accretion-related phenomena as the origin of the gas emission lines. Shocks in jets and outflowing material are more likely to play a significant role than shocks in infalling material. The role of X-ray irradiation is less prominent but still present for [Ne II], in particular for Class II sources, while the lack of correlation between [Fe II] and [Ne II] points toward different emitting mechanisms.

	Abstract = {We present multidimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer models of hydrogen and helium line profiles formed in the accretion flows and the outflows near the star-disc interaction regions of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). The statistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the Sobolev approximation using the radiative transfer code TORUS, have been improved to include He I and He II energy levels. This allows us to probe the physical conditions of the inner wind of CTTSs by simultaneously modelling the robust wind diagnostic line He Ilambda10830 and the accretion diagnostic lines such as Pabeta, Brgamma and He Ilambda5876. The code has been tested in 1D and 2D problems, and we have shown that the results are in agreement with established codes. We apply the model to the complex flow geometries of CTTSs. Example model profiles are computed using the combinations of (1) magnetospheric accretion and disc wind, and (2) magnetospheric accretion and the stellar wind. In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are qualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent with the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He Ilambda10830 seen in observations is caused by a disc wind, and the wider blueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar stellar wind. However, we do not have a strong constraint on the relative importance of the wind and the magnetosphere for the 'emission' component. Our preliminary calculations suggest that the temperature of the disc wind and stellar winds cannot be much higher than ˜10 000 K, on the basis of the strengths of hydrogen lines. Similarly the temperature of the magnetospheric accretion cannot be much higher than ˜10 000 K. With these low temperatures, we find that the photoionization by high-energy photons (e.g. X-rays) is necessary to produce He Ilambda10830 in emission and to produce the blueshifted absorption components.},

Using light-curve modelling under the assumption of internal invariability of spots, we obtained small values of the solar-type differential-rotation parameter (k = 0.0005-0.009) for three spotted weak-line T Tauri stars, V410 Tau, V987 Tau and Lupus 3-14; for another spotted weak-line T Tauri star (WTTS), Lupus 3-48, the data are consistent with a rigidly rotating surface (k = 0). Three flares of similar rise (4 min and 30 s) and decay (1 h and 45 min) times were detected in the light curve of Lupus 3-14. The brightness of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau continuously decreased over 3 weeks of its observations with a variable modulation not showing any obvious periodic signal.

	Abstract = {Circumstellar disks are thought to experience a rapid "transition" phase in their evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation and early development of planetary systems. We present new and archival high angular resolution (0farcs3 ≈ 40-75 AU) Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the 880 mum (340 GHz) dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearby star-forming regions. In each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central star. Using two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric model framework by reproducing their SMA continuum visibilities and spectral energy distributions. The cavities in these disks are large (R cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small (~mum-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. The structures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal disks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are relatively common among the millimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 1 in 5 (20%) of the disks in the bright half (and >=26% of the upper quartile) of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution. Utilizing these results, we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to account for transition disk structures. As has been shown before, photoevaporation models do not produce the large cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk masses representative of this sample. A sufficient decrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth would be difficult to achieve: substantial growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of AU) regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small particles. Given those challenges, we suggest instead that the observations are most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions with low-mass companions---very young (~1 Myr) brown dwarfs or giant planets on long-period orbits.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results from time-series imaging at infrared wavelengths of 0.9 deg2 in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). During Fall 2009 we obtained 81 epochs of Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 mum data over 40 consecutive days. We extracted light curves with ~3% photometric accuracy for ~2000 ONC members ranging from several solar masses down to well below the hydrogen-burning mass limit. For many of the stars, we also have time-series photometry obtained at optical (Ic ) and/or near-infrared (JK s ) wavelengths. Our data set can be mined to determine stellar rotation periods, identify new pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries, search for new substellar Orion members, and help better determine the frequency of circumstellar disks as a function of stellar mass in the ONC. Our primary focus is the unique ability of 3.6 and 4.5 mum variability information to improve our understanding of inner disk processes and structure in the Class I and II young stellar objects (YSOs). In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the YSOVAR Orion data obtained in Fall 2009 and highlight our light curves for AA-Tau analogs---YSOs with narrow dips in flux, most probably due to disk density structures passing through our line of sight. Detailed follow-up observations are needed in order to better quantify the nature of the obscuring bodies and what this implies for the structure of the inner disks of YSOs.},

	Abstract = {We address the question of whether protoplanetary discs around low-mass stars (e.g. M-dwarfs) may be longer lived than their solar-type counterparts. This question is particularly relevant in assessing the planet-making potential of these lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young stars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial distribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of disc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference between the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest-neighbour distance (normalized to the number of sources), where the older population should appear more spread out. To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial distribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low-mass star-forming regions. We find no evidence for significant age differences between the disc-bearing low-mass (later than M2) and 'solar-type' (earlier than M2) stars in these regions. We model our results by constructing and analysing synthetic fractal distributions that we evolve for typical values of the velocity dispersions. A comparison of results obtained using simple models to the results from our MST analysis suggests that the lifetime of discs around M-stars is similar to that of discs around solar-type stars. Furthermore, a model-independent spatial analysis of the observations robustly shows that any age differences between the two samples must be smaller than the average age difference between disc-bearing classical T Tauri stars and discless weak-lined T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We report here results of spectropolarimetric observations of the ~=8 Myr classical T Tauri star (cTTS) TW Hya carried out with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the framework of the 'Magnetic Protostars and Planets' programme, and obtained at two different epochs (2008 March and 2010 March). Obvious Zeeman signatures are detected at all times, both in photospheric lines and in accretion-powered emission lines. Significant intrinsic variability and moderate rotational modulation are observed in both photospheric and accretion proxies. Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field of the photospheric brightness and the accretion-powered emission at the surface of TW Hya at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly poloidal and axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis of the star and that the octupolar component of the large-scale field (2.5-2.8 kG at the pole) largely dominates the dipolar component. This large-scale field topology is characteristic of partly convective stars, supporting the conclusion (from evolutionary models) that TW Hya already hosts a radiative core. We also show that TW Hya features a high-latitude photospheric cool spot overlapping with the main magnetic pole (and producing the observed radial velocity fluctuations); this is also where accretion concentrates most of the time, although accretion at lower latitudes is found to occur episodically. We propose that the relatively rapid rotation of TW Hya (with respect to AA Tau-like cTTSs) directly reflects the weakness of the large-scale dipole, no longer capable of magnetically disrupting the accretion disc up to the corotation radius (at which the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation period). We therefore conclude that TW Hya is in a phase of rapid spin-up as its large-scale dipole field progressively vanishes.},

	Abstract = {Young circumstellar disks that are still embedded in dense molecular envelopes may differ from their older counterparts, but are historically difficult to study because emission from a disk can be confused with envelope or outflow emission. CO fundamental emission is a potentially powerful probe of the disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we present high spectral (R = 90 000) and spatial (˜0.3 arcsec) resolution VLT/CRIRES M-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes in nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental (Deltav = 1) 4.6 mum emission as a probe of very young disks. CO fundamental emission is detected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a range of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad, warm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected more frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 L&sun; than those with >15 L&sun;. The broad emission shares many of the same properties as CO fundamental emission seen from more mature disks around classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) and is similarly attributed to the warm (~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. CO emission from the inner disk is not detected from most YSOs with a high bolometric luminosity. Instead, the CO emission from those objects is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and in rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by up to ~10 km s-1, indicating a slow wind or outflow origin. For other sources the lines are located at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For a few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H2 S(9) emission is detected up to ~2'' from the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and surrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of six objects with velocities up to 100 km s-1, often in discrete velocity components. That the wind is partially molecular where it is launched favors ejection in a disk wind rather than a coronal or chromospheric wind.

	Abstract = {Non-ideal MHD effects play an important role in the gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This paper addresses the influence of non-ideal MHD effects on the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and angular momentum transport in PPDs using the most up-to-date results from numerical simulations. We perform chemistry calculations using a complex reaction network with standard prescriptions for X-ray and cosmic-ray ionizations. We first show that whether or not grains are included, the recombination time is at least one order of magnitude less than the orbital time within five disk scale heights, justifying the validity of local ionization equilibrium and strong coupling limit in PPDs. The full conductivity tensor at different disk radii and heights is evaluated, with the MRI active region determined by requiring that (1) the Ohmic Elsasser number Lambda be greater than 1 and (2) the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure beta be greater than betamin(Am) as identified in the recent study by Bai & Stone, where Am is the Elsasser number for ambipolar diffusion. With full flexibility as to the magnetic field strength, we provide a general framework for estimating the MRI-driven accretion rate \dot{M} and the magnetic field strength in the MRI active layer. We find that the MRI active layer always exists at any disk radius as long as the magnetic field in PPDs is sufficiently weak. However, the optimistically predicted \dot{M} in the inner disk (r = 1-10 AU) appears insufficient to account for the observed range of accretion rates in PPDs (around 10-8 M sun yr-1) even in the grain-free calculation, and the presence of solar abundance sub-micron grains further reduces \dot{M} by one to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we find that the predicted \dot{M} increases with radius in the inner disk where accretion is layered, which would lead to runaway mass accumulation if disk accretion is solely driven by the MRI. Our results suggest that stronger sources of ionization and/or additional mechanisms such as magnetized wind are needed to explain the observed accretion rates in PPDs. In contrast, our predicted \dot{M} is on the order of 10-9 M sun yr-1 in the outer disk, consistent with the observed accretion rates in transitional disks.},

	Abstract = {The pre-main-sequence (PMS) star V1647 Ori has recently undergone two optical/near-infrared (OIR) outbursts that are associated with dramatic enhancements in the stellar accretion rate. Our intensive X-ray monitoring of this object affords the opportunity to investigate whether and how the intense X-ray emission is related to PMS accretion activity. Our analysis of all 14 Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of V1647 Ori demonstrates that variations in the X-ray luminosity of V1647 Ori are correlated with similar changes in the OIR brightness of this source during both (2003-2005 and 2008) eruptions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that accretion is the primary generation mechanism for the X-ray outbursts. Furthermore, the Chandra monitoring demonstrates that the X-ray spectral properties of the second eruption were strikingly similar to those of the 2003 eruption. We find that X-ray spectra obtained immediately following the second outburst---during which V1647 Ori exhibited high X-ray luminosities, high hardness ratios, and strong X-ray variability---are well modeled as a heavily absorbed (N H ~ 4 × 1022 cm-2), single-component plasma with characteristic temperatures (kT X ~ 2-6 keV) that are consistently too high to be generated via accretion shocks but are in the range expected for plasma heated by magnetic reconnection events. We also find that the X-ray absorbing column has not changed significantly throughout the observing campaign. Since the OIR and X-ray changes are correlated, we hypothesize that these reconnection events either occur in the accretion stream connecting the circumstellar disk to the star or in accretion-enhanced protostellar coronal activity.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the distribution of stellar ages in the Orion nebula cluster (ONC) using accurate HST photometry taken from HST Treasury Program observations of the ONC utilizing the cluster distance estimated by Menten and collaborators. We investigate whether there is an intrinsic age spread in the region and whether the age depends on the spatial distribution. Methods: We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity towards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical calibration of atmospheric models using the package Chorizos of Maiz-Apellaniz. The position of the sources in the HR-diagram is compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster age and age dispersion. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the amount of intrinsic age spread in the region, taking into account uncertainties in the distance, spectral type, extinction, unresolved binaries, accretion, and photometric variability. Results: According to the evolutionary models of Siess and collaborators, the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myr. With Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent with that of a coeval stellar population, but in agreement with a star formation activity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myr. We also observe some evidence that ages depends on the spatial distribution.},

	Abstract = {Ices regulate much of the chemistry during star formation and account for up to 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN, and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in an H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freezeout levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation, and the formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances is consistent with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, LX /L bolvpropRobeta, is fit as beta = -2.70 $\pm$ 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical beta = -2 slope to a confidence of 5sigma, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies DeltaOmega/OmegavpropOmega0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro < 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We studied four young star clusters to characterise their anomalous extinction or variable reddening and asses whether they could be due to contamination by either dense clouds or circumstellar effects. Methods: We evaluated the extinction law (RV) by adopting two methods: (i) the use of theoretical expressions based on the colour-excess of stars with known spectral type; and (ii) the analysis of two-colour diagrams, where the slope of the observed colour distribution was compared to the normal distribution. An algorithm to reproduce the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) reddened colours was developed to derive the average visual extinction (AV) that provides the closest fit to the observational data. The structure of the clouds was evaluated by means of a statistical fractal analysis, designed to compare their geometric structure with the spatial distribution of the cluster members. Results: The cluster NGC 6530 is the only object of our sample affected by anomalous extinction. On average, the other clusters suffer normal extinction, but several of their members, mainly in NGC 2264, seem to have high RV, probably because of circumstellar effects. The ZAMS fitting provides AV values that are in good agreement with those found in the literature. The fractal analysis shows that NGC 6530 has a centrally concentrated distribution of stars that differs from the substructures found in the density distribution of the cloud projected in the AV map, suggesting that the original cloud was changed by the cluster formation. However, the fractal dimension and statistical parameters of Berkeley 86, NGC 2244, and NGC 2264 indicate that there is a good cloud-cluster correlation, when compared to other works based on an artificial distribution of points.

	Abstract = {The nearest accreting T Tauri star, TW Hya was intensively and continuously observed over ~17 days with spectroscopic and photometric measurements from four continents simultaneous with a long segmented exposure using the Chandra satellite. Contemporaneous optical photometry from WASP-S indicates a 4.74 day period was present during this time. The absence of a similar periodicity in the Halpha flux and the total X-ray flux which are dominated by accretion processes and the stellar corona, respectively, points to a different source of photometric variations. The Halpha emission line appears intrinsically broad and symmetric, and both the profile and its variability suggest an origin in the post-shock cooling region. An accretion event, signaled by soft X-rays, is traced spectroscopically for the first time through the optical emission line profiles. After the accretion event, downflowing turbulent material observed in the Halpha and Hbeta lines is followed by He I (lambda5876) broadening near the photosphere. Optical veiling resulting from the heated photosphere increases with a delay of ~2 hr after the X-ray accretion event. The response of the stellar coronal emission to an increase in the veiling follows ~2.4 hr later, giving direct evidence that the stellar corona is heated in part by accretion. Subsequently, the stellar wind becomes re-established. We suggest a model that incorporates the dynamics of this sequential series of events: an accretion shock, a cooling downflow in a supersonically turbulent region, followed by photospheric and later, coronal heating. This model naturally explains the presence of broad optical and ultraviolet lines, and affects the mass accretion rates determined from emission line profiles.},

	Abstract = {Mechanisms regulating the origin of X-rays in young stellar objects and the correlation with their evolutionary stage are under debate. Studies of the X-ray properties in young clusters allow us to understand these mechanisms. One ideal target for this analysis is the Eagle Nebula (M16), with its central cluster NGC 6611. At 1750 pc from the Sun, it harbors 93 OB stars, together with a population of low-mass stars from embedded protostars to disk-less Class III objects, with age <=3 Myr. We study an archival 78 ks Chandra/ACIS-I observation of NGC 6611 and two new 80 ks observations of the outer region of M16, one centered on the Column V and the other on a region of the molecular cloud with ongoing star formation. We detect 1755 point sources with 1183 candidate cluster members (219 disk-bearing and 964 disk-less). We study the global X-ray properties of M16 and compare them with those of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also compare the level of X-ray emission of Class II and Class III stars and analyze the X-ray spectral properties of OB stars. Our study supports the lower level of X-ray activity for the disk-bearing stars with respect to the disk-less members. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of M16 is similar to that of Orion, supporting the universality of the XLF in young clusters. Eighty-five percent of the O stars of NGC 6611 have been detected in X-rays. With only one possible exception, they show soft spectra with no hard components, indicating that mechanisms for the production of hard X-ray emission in O stars are not operating in NGC 6611.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the soft X-ray light curves from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites over the last 37 years (1975-2011) and measured with an automated flare detection algorithm over 300,000 solar flare events (amounting to ≈5 times higher sensitivity than the NOAA flare catalog). We find a power-law slope of alpha F = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.11 for the (background-subtracted) soft X-ray peak fluxes that is invariant through three solar cycles and agrees with the theoretical prediction alpha F = 2.0 of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model. For the soft X-ray flare rise times, we find a power-law slope of alpha T = 2.02 $\pm$ 0.04 during solar cycle minima years, which is also consistent with the prediction alpha T = 2.0 of the FD-SOC model. During solar cycle maxima years, the power-law slope is steeper in the range of alpha T ≈ 2.0-5.0, which can be modeled by a solar-cycle-dependent flare pile-up bias effect. These results corroborate the FD-SOC model, which predicts a power-law slope of alpha E = 1.5 for flare energies and thus rules out significant nanoflare heating. While the FD-SOC model predicts the probability distribution functions of spatio-temporal scaling laws of nonlinear energy dissipation processes, additional physical models are needed to derive the scaling laws between the geometric SOC parameters and the observed emissivity in different wavelength regimes, as we derive here for soft X-ray emission. The FD-SOC model also yields statistical probabilities for solar flare forecasting.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a multiplicity survey of 212 T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon I and Taurus-Auriga star-forming regions, based on high-resolution spectra from the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope. From these data, we achieved a typical radial velocity (RV) precision of ~80 m s-1 with slower rotators yielding better precision, in general. For 174 of these stars, we obtained multi-epoch data with sufficient time baselines to identify binaries based on RV variations. We identified eight close binaries and four close triples, of which three and two, respectively, are new discoveries. The spectroscopic multiplicity fractions we find for Chamaeleon I (7%) and Taurus-Auriga (6%) are similar to each other, and to the results of field star surveys in the same mass and period regime. However, unlike the results from imaging surveys, the frequency of systems with close companions in our sample is not seen to depend on primary mass. Additionally, we do not find a strong correlation between accretion and close multiplicity. This implies that close companions are not likely the main source of the accretion shut down observed in weak-lined T Tauri stars. Our results also suggest that sufficient RV precision can be achieved for at least a subset of slowly rotating young stars to search for hot Jupiter planets.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the influence of rotation and disc lifetime on lithium depletion of pre-main sequence (PMS) solar-type stars.  Methods: The impact of rotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium abundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models that include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of the disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS rotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase between 3 and 9 Myr.  Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of the lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work. This results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models compared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the stellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to differential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing results in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited contribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium depletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation on PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the disc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance of a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational mixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the zero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast rotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.},

	Abstract = {We report initial results from a quasi-simultaneous X-ray/optical observing campaign targeting V4046 Sgr, a close, synchronous-rotating classical T Tauri star (CTTS) binary in which both components are actively accreting. V4046 Sgr is a strong X-ray source, with the X-rays mainly arising from high-density (n e~ 1011-1012 cm-3) plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK. Our multi-wavelength campaign aims to simultaneously constrain the properties of this X-ray-emitting plasma, the large-scale magnetic field, and the accretion geometry. In this paper, we present key results obtained via time-resolved X-ray-grating spectra, gathered in a 360 ks XMM-Newton observation that covered 2.2 system rotations. We find that the emission lines produced by this high-density plasma display periodic flux variations with a measured period, 1.22 $\pm$ 0.01 d, that is precisely half that of the binary star system (2.42 d). The observed rotational modulation can be explained assuming that the high-density plasma occupies small portions of the stellar surfaces, corotating with the stars, and that the high-density plasma is not azimuthally symmetrically distributed with respect to the rotational axis of each star. These results strongly support models in which high-density, X-ray-emitting CTTS plasma is material heated in accretion shocks, located at the base of accretion flows tied to the system by magnetic field lines.},

	Abstract = {Three X-ray sources found serendipitously in Einstein images of the Taurus-Auriga cloud complex were observed at the McGraw-Hill Observatory and are found to be associated with stars of approximately 12 mag with weak H-alpha emission. The stars lie on the edges of dark clouds and are spectroscopically similar to the least active emission-line pre-main-sequence stars. Although they lie well above the ZAMS in the H-R diagram, they do not exhibit ultraviolet excess, strong optical variability, or evidence for mass outflow/inflow characteristics of the more active T Tauri stars. Their only unusual property is high X-ray luminosity (approximately 10 to the 30th ergs/s). It is suggested that the X-ray emission from pre-main-sequence stars is not closely linked to the conditions giving rise to their unusual spectroscopic properties. The emission may instead represent an enhanced form of the coronal activity producing X-rays observed in late-type main-sequence stars.},

	Abstract = {A scenario for early stellar formation is presented, based on the current understanding of global processes (such as spiral density waves, sequential star formation, the dynamic evolution of OB associations and clusters and the initial mass function) and the formation and early evolution of individual objects. Studies of the early dynamical evolution of OB associations support the contention that the unbound dynamical state of OB associations is a result of the combination of low star-formation efficiency and rapid and efficient gas dispersal. The question of why low star formation efficiency plays a role in the star formation process is addressed. Special attention is given to the evolution of protostars and young stellar objects. The utility of studying the optical-IR broadband energy distributions of embedded sources is emphasized, and the prospects of such studies for uncovering true protostars and directly deciphering the star formation process itself is discussed.},

	Abstract = {It is suggested that the winds of T Tauri stars are heated at distances of 50-100 AU by oblique shocks with circumstellar disks, producing the observed high-velocity forbidden-line emission. The low shock velocities characteristic of this model provide low-excitation emission and line profiles in reasonable agreement with observations. The blueshifted character of the observed emission is explained by a combination of disk occultation of the receding flow, plus a modest collimation of the observable wind by the disk envelope. Instabilities at the wind-disk interface may be important in producing the observed emission.},

	Abstract = {Einstein X-ray observations of regions of active star formation in Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Corona Australis show a greatly enhanced surface density of stellar X-ray sources over that seen in other parts of the sky. Many of the X-ray sources are identified with low-mass, pre-main-sequence stars which are not classical T Tauri stars. The X-ray, photometric, and spectroscopic data for these stars are discussed. Seven early K stars in Oph and CrA are likely to be 1-solar-mass post-T Tauri stars with ages of 10-million yr. The late K stars in Taurus are not post-T Tauri, but 'naked' T Tauri stars, which are coeval with the T Tauri stars, differing mainly in the lack of a circumstellar envelope.},

	Abstract = {We have examined one of the key predictions of the magnetospheric infall model for classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), namely, the formation of a shock on the stellar surface. We find that accretion column emission can successfully reproduce the main observational properties of the excess continuum that veils the absorption features in CTTS. This success adds further support to the magnetospheric infall model for disk accretion. We have calculated the structure and the spectral energy distribution of the emergent continuum emission from a shock at the base of the magnetospheric accretion column. We find that the spectral shape of the excess can be understood as optically thick emission from the heated photosphere below the shock, appearing mostly on the Paschen and Brackett continua, and optically thin emission from the preshock and attenuated postshock regions, dominating at wavelengths shorter than the Balmer threshold. The accretion luminosity and rate depend on two parameters: the energy flux of the accretion flow, F, and the surface coverage of the column, f, with typical values log F~10.5-11.5, of the order or up to a factor of 10 higher than the intrinsic stellar flux, and f ~ 0.1%-1% of the surface area. The so-called continuum stars have accretion columns with similar energy fluxes than the less veiled, typical CTTS but with much larger surface emitting areas of f >= 10%. At near-infrared wavelengths, the predicted veiling from the accretion column for typical CTTS parameters is nearly constant and <=0.1. Only for the ``continuum stars'' are significant amounts of near-infrared veiling from the accretion column expected. For accretion columns with low values of F, the Paschen continuum emission has spectral features, rendering the usual deveiling procedures uncertain. Magnetospheric flow Balmer emission may also contribute to the excess for stars with low-F columns. Finally, accretion column emission can successfully reproduce the observed correlation between the excess luminosity at the U band and the accretion luminosity. This correlation does not depend on the characteristics (mass, spectral type) of the underlying star, at least in the range M3-K5.},

	Abstract = {Most stellar flares' soft X-ray light curves possess a 'typical' morphology, which consists of a rapid rise followed by a slow exponential decay. However, a study of 216 of the brightest flares on 161 pre-main-sequence stars, observed during the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), showed that many flare light curves depart from this typical morphology. While this can be attributed to the superposition of multiple typical flares, we explore the possibility that the time-variable eclipsing of flares by their host stars may also be an important factor. We assume each flare is contained within a single, uniform plasma density magnetic loop and specify the intrinsic variation of the flare's emission measure with time. We consider rotational eclipse not only by the star itself, but also by circumstellar discs and flare-associated prominences. Based on this simple model, we generate a set of flares similar to those observed in the COUP data base. Many eclipses simply reduce the flare's maximum emission measure or decay time. We conclude therefore that eclipses often pass undetected, but usually have only a modest influence on the flare emission measure profile and hence the derived loop lengths. We show that eclipsing can easily reproduce the observed atypical flare morphologies. The number of atypical modelled flare morphologies is, however, much less than that found in the COUP sample. The large number of observed atypical flare morphologies, therefore, must be attributed to other processes such as multiple flaring loops.},

	Abstract = {Constraining the spatial and thermal structure of the gaseous component of circumstellar disks is crucial for understanding star and planet formation. Models predict that the [Ne II] line at 12.81 mum detected in young stellar objects (YSOs) with Spitzer traces disk gas and its response to high-energy radiation, but such [Ne II] emission may also originate in shocks within powerful outflows. To distinguish between these potential origins for mid-infrared [Ne II] emission and to constrain disk models, we observed 32 YSOs using the high-resolution (R ~ 30,000) mid-infrared spectrograph VISIR at the Very Large Telescope. We detected the 12.81 mum [Ne II] line in 12 objects, tripling the number of detections of this line in YSOs with high spatial and spectral resolution spectrographs. We obtain the following main results. (1) In Class I objects the [Ne II] emission observed from Spitzer is mainly due to gas at a distance of more than 20-40 AU from the star, where neon is, most likely, ionized by shocks due to protostellar outflows. (2) In transition and pre-transition disks, most of the emission is confined to the inner disk, within 20-40 AU from the central star. (3) Detailed analysis of line profiles indicates that, in transition and pre-transition disks, the line is slightly blueshifted (2-12 km s-1) with respect to the stellar velocity, and the line width is directly correlated with the disk inclination, as expected if the emission is due to a disk wind. (4) Models of EUV/X-ray-irradiated disks reproduce well the observed relation between the line width and the disk inclination, but underestimate the blueshift of the line.  Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile, with the mid-infrared spectrograph and imager VISIR (Program IDs 083.C-0883, 084.C-0211, and 085.C-0860).},

	Abstract = {Context: The interpretation of X-ray detections from Herbig Ae/Be stars is disputed as it is not clear whether these intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars are able to drive a dynamo and ensuing phenomena of magnetic activity. Alternative X-ray production mechanisms, related to stellar winds, star-disk magnetospheres, or unresolved late-type T Tauri star companions have been proposed.   Aims: The companion hypothesis can be tested by resolving Herbig stars in X-rays from their known visual secondaries. Furthermore, their global X-ray properties (such as detection rate, luminosity, temperature, variability) may give clues to the emission mechanism by comparison to other types of stars, e.g. similar-age but lower-mass T Tauri stars, similar-mass but more evolved main-sequence A- and B-type stars, and with respect to model predictions.   Methods: In a series of papers we have been investigating high-resolution X-ray Chandra images of Herbig Ae/Be and main-sequence B-type stars where known close visual companions are spatially separated from the primaries.   Results: Here we report on six as yet unpublished Chandra exposures from our X-ray survey of Herbig stars. The target list comprises six Herbig stars with known cool companions, and three other A/B-type stars that are serendipitously in the Chandra field-of-view. In this sample we record a detection rate of 100%; i.e. all A/B-type stars display X-ray emission at levels of log(L_x/L_bol) ~ -5...-7. The analysis of hardness ratios confirms that HAeBes have hotter and/or more absorbed X-ray emitting plasma than more evolved B-type stars. Conclusions: Radiative winds are ruled out as an exclusive emission mechanism on the basis of the high X-ray temperatures. Confirming earlier results, the X-ray properties of Herbig Ae/Be stars are not vastly different from those of their late-type companion stars (if such are known). The diagnostics provided by the presently available data leave it open whether the hard X-ray emission of Herbig stars is due to young age or indicative of further coronally active low-mass companion stars. In the latter case, our detection statistics imply a high fraction of higher order multiple systems among Herbig stars.},

	Abstract = {We present ASCA results of intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars, or Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. Among the 35 ASCA pointed sources, we detect 11 plausible X-ray counterparts. X-ray luminosities of the detected sources in the 0.5-10 keV band are in the range of logLX~30-32 ergs s-1, which is systematically higher than those of low-mass PMS stars. This fact suggests that the contribution of a possible low-mass companion is not large. Most of the bright sources show significant time variation; in particular, two HAeBe stars-MWC 297 and TY CrA-exhibit flarelike events with long decay timescales (e-folding time ~10-60 ks). These flare shapes are similar to those of low-mass PMS stars. The X-ray spectra are successfully reproduced by an absorbed one- or two-temperature thin-thermal plasma model. The temperatures are in the range of kT~1-5 keV, significantly higher than those of main-sequence OB stars (kT<1 keV). These X-ray properties are not explained by wind-driven shocks, but are more likely due to magnetic activity. On the other hand, the plasma temperature rises as absorption column density increases or as HAeBe stars ascend to earlier phases. The X-ray luminosity reduces after stellar age of a few times 106 yr. X-ray activity may be related to stellar evolution. The age of the activity decay is apparently near the termination of jet or outflow activity. We thus hypothesize that magnetic activity originates from the interaction of the large-scale magnetic fields coupled to the circumstellar disk. We also discuss differences in X-ray properties between HAeBe stars and main-sequence OB stars.},

	Abstract = {We have observed 14 Herbig Ae/Be stars in X-rays with the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) (0.1-2.4 keV). In addition, we obtained data from the ROSAT archive for 7 Herbig Ae/Be stars. As a result, 11 of the 21 Herbig Ae/Be stars studied here have been detected as X-ray sources, among them AB Aur, HR 5999/6000, and Z CMa. We have investigated possible correlations between the X-ray luminosity and other stellar parameters like Lbol, spectral type, stellar rotation and winds. We suspect that the origin of the X-ray emission is likely to be related to the stellar wind, although other explanations (e.g. unresolved T Tauri companions) are also discussed. Some Ae/Be stars are known to be the exciting sources of high-velocity jets, but none of the jets themselves were detected in X-rays. In several cases, the X-ray images revealed a small cluster of sources, presumably lower mass pre-main-sequence objects that surround the more massive Ae/Be stars.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars, using the full set of Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter (IPC) observations. Of a total of 31 observed Herbig stars, 11 are confidently identified with X-ray sources, with four additonal dubious identifications. We have used maximum likelihood luminosity functions to study the distribution of X-ray luminosity, and we find that Be stars are significantly brighter in X-rays than Ae stars and that their X-ray luminosity is independent of projected rotational velocity v sin i. The X-ray emission is instead correlated with stellar bolometric luminosity and with effective temperature, and also with the kinetic luminosity of the stellar wind. These results seem to exclude a solar-like origin for the X-ray emission, a possibility suggested by the most recent models of Herbig stars' structure, and suggest an analogy with the X-ray emission of O (and early B) stars. We also observe correlations between X-ray luminosity and the emission at 2.2 microns (K band) and 25 microns, which strengthen the case for X-ray emission of Herbig stars originating in their circumstellar envelopes.},

	Abstract = {We study the X-ray emission of T Tauri stars (TTS) in Taurus-Auriga as observed with the spatially unbiased flux-limited ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Our detection rates are comparable with Einstein Observatory results: 43 out of 65 (66%) weak-line TTS (WTTS) and 9 out of 79 (11%) classical TTS (CTTS) exhibit X-ray emission above the ROSAT survey detection limit. Spectral fits give results consistent with Raymond-Smith spectra and emission temperatures of ~1keV for both CTTS and WTTS. However, we find that CTTS and WTTS have significantly different X-ray luminosity functions, even when correcting luminosities for individual X-ray spectra (absorption and emission energy). Medians of X-ray luminosities log (L_X_/erg/sec) are 29.701+/-0.045 for WTTS and 29.091+/-0.032 for CTTS, all in 140pc distance. A strong correlation between X-ray surface flux and stellar rotation indicates that WTTS are intrinsically more X-ray active than CTTS because WTTS rotate faster. However, rotation is not the only parameter that determines X-ray activity, we find that X-ray luminosity is correlated with stellar mass, bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, and stellar age. Furthermore, X-ray emission of CTTS appears to be harder than that of WTTS.},

The sample of low-mass pre-main sequence stars detected with the spatially complete flux-limited RASS consists mainly of weak-emission line T Tauri stars (WTTS). Two thirds of all RASS X-ray sources cannot be identitifed with known stellar or extragalactic counterparts. Based on the fraction of spectroscopically identified WTTS among a sample of previously unidentified RASS sources, we extrapolate a lower limit for the total number of WTTS in and around Taurus-Auriga: WTTS outnumber classical TTS by at least a factor of 8. A selection criterion for WTTS candidates is established based on the low-resolution X-ray spectra of identified WTTS. We achieve a selection reliability of 54%.},

	Abstract = {On the basis of the full set of reanalyzed Einstein IPC X-ray data on Taurus-Auriga pre-main-sequence stars, presented in a companion paper, we have studied the relationships between the X-ray emission and typical diagnostics of pre-main-sequence activity to obtain indications of the origin of the X-ray emission and of the structure of the outer atmospheres in these stars. We argue that, in the case of classical T Tauri stars, scaling the Halpha luminosity to the infrared (disk) emission is much more meaningful physically than scaling it to the stellar continuum (by considering the line equivalent width). We find an inverse relation between the X-ray luminosity and this infrared-scaled Halpha emission. We also find an anticorrelation between X-ray luminosity and rotational period, in qualitative agreement with earlier works; this is interpreted in terms of a magnetic origin for the X-ray emission. This relationship, however, is limited to stars younger than 2 × 106 yr, while for the older sample stars, saturation of X-ray surface flux appears to take place. We interpret the relation found between X-ray and infrared-scaled Halpha emission as a competition between closed and open magnetic structures on the surface of these stars. In the stars without indications of winds and accretion disks (weak-line T Tauri stars), a correlation between X-ray luminosity and unscaled Halpha luminosity is found instead, providing further evidence for the chromospheric origin of the line emission in these latter stars.},

	Abstract = {We present a systematic reanalysis of the Einstein IPC X-ray data on the pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region. We consider all cataloged stars in this region which have been observed with the IPC; of these, 52 out of 68 can be identified with X-ray sources; upper limits on the X-ray luminosity have been evaluated in the remaining cases. We derive an X-ray luminosity function and argue that its median Lx is representative of the population intrinsic value, in spite of incompleteness of the sample and possible ambiguities in the X-ray source identifications. As a result, it is confirmed that the known steady increase in the average level of X-ray emission toward younger ages can be extended to the pre-main-sequence phase. By using the line equivalent width as the relevant parameter, a statistically significant difference is found between the distributions of X-ray luminosities of stars with and without strong emission lines. No such difference is found instead between stars with and without strong infrared excess at 25 mum.},

	Abstract = {The inner 0.1 AU around accreting T Tauri stars hold clues to many physical processes that characterize the early evolution of solar-type stars. The accretion-ejection connection takes place at least in part in this compact magnetized region around the central star, with the inner disk edge interacting with the star's magnetosphere, thus leading simultaneously to magnetically channeled accretion flows and to high-velocity winds and outflows. The magnetic star-disk interaction is thought to have strong implications for the angular momentum evolution of the central system, the inner structure of the disk, and possibly halting the migration of young planets close to the stellar surface. We review here the current status of magnetic field measurements in T Tauri stars, the recent modeling efforts of the magnetospheric accretion process, including both radiative transfer and multi-dimensional numerical simulations, and summarize current evidence supporting the concept of magnetically channeled accretion in young stars. We also discuss the limits of the models and highlight observational results that suggest the star-disk interaction is a highly dynamical and time-variable process in young stars.},

	Abstract = {We combine our previous optical spectroscopic and photometric analysis of ~1600 stars located in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with our own and published near-infrared photometric surveys of the region in order to investigate the evidence for and properties of circumstellar disks. We use the near-infrared continuum excess as our primary disk diagnostic, although we also study sources with Ca ii triplet emission and those designated as ``proplyds.'' The measured near-infrared excess is influenced by (1) the presence or absence of a circumstellar disk, (2) the relative importance of disk accretion and inner disk holes, (3) the relative contrast between photospheric and disk emission, and (4) system inclination. After attempting to understand the effects of these influences, we estimate the frequency of circumstellar disks and discuss the evidence for trends in the disk frequency with stellar mass (over the mass range <0.1-50 M_&sun;), stellar age (over the age range <0.1-2 Myr), and projected cluster radius (over the radial range 0-3 pc). We find that the fraction of stars retaining their inner (<0.1 AU) circumstellar disks to the present time is at least 55% and probably no more than 90%, averaged over the entire range in stellar mass and stellar age represented in the ONC and over the entire area of our survey. We find no trend in the disk fraction with stellar age, at least not over the limited age range of the cluster. We find that more massive stars are less likely to have disks, consistent with a scenario in which the evolutionary timescales are more rapid for disks surrounding more massive stars than for disks surrounding less massive stars. We also find that the disk frequency begins to decrease toward the lowest masses, although objects of all masses (including those that appear to be substellar) can have disks. We find that the disk frequency increases toward the cluster center. We then argue, using several lines of evidence, that a large fraction of the disks associated with stars in the ONC are accretion disks. The observed trends with stellar age, stellar mass, and projected cluster radius in the disk frequency may, in fact, be driven primarily by trends in the disk accretion properties. From the magnitude of the near-infrared excess above that expected from pure irradiation disks, we find an accretion disk fraction among the stars identified as having disks of 61%-88%. In addition, approximately 20% of the stars in our optical spectroscopic sample show broad (several hundred km s^-1 FWHM) Ca ii emission lines, which are features often associated with accretion disk/wind phenomena; another 50% of the sample have Ca ii lines that (at our spectral resolution) are ``filled in,'' indicating an independently derived accretion disk frequency of ~70%. Finally, we discuss the near-infrared and optical emission-line properties of that portion of our sample identified from Hubble Space Telescope imaging as having a dark silhouette or an externally ionized structure. This sample, proposed in the literature to have accretion disks, appears to be no different in terms of its stellar or circumstellar properties from the rest of the ONC population. The only feature distinguishing these objects from their ONC siblings thus may be their current (but short-lived) proximity to the massive stars near the cluster center.},

	Abstract = {We report on the first phase of a study of the stellar population comprising the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Approximately 50% of the ~ 3500 stars identified to date within ~ 2.5 pc of the namesake Trapezium stars are optically visible, and in this paper we focus on that sample with I < 17.5 mag. The large number and number density (npeak > 10(4) pc(-3) ) of stars, the wide range in stellar mass ( ~ 0.1-50 M_&sun;), and the extreme youth (< 1-2 Myr) of the stellar population, make the ONC the best site for investigating: 1) the detailed shape of a truly ``initial'' mass spectrum; 2) the apparent age spread in a region thought to have undergone triggered star formation; 3) the time sequence of star formation as a function of stellar mass; and 4) trends of all of the above with cluster radius. Nearly 60% of the ~ 1600 optical stars have sufficient data (spectroscopy and photometry) for placement on a theoretical HR diagram; this subsample is unbiased with respect to apparent brightness or cluster radius, complete down to ~ 1 M_&sun;, and representative of the total optical sample below ~ 1 M_&sun; for the age and extinction ranges characteristic of the cluster. Comparison of the derived HR diagram with traditional pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations shows a trend of increasing stellar age with increasing stellar mass. To avoid the implication of earlier characteristic formation times for higher-mass stars than for lower-mass stars, refinement of early evolutionary theory in a manner similar to the birthline hypothesis of Palla & Stahler (1993), is required. Subject to uncertainties in the tracks and isochrones, we can still investigate stellar mass and age distributions in the ONC. We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mass spectrum which is not grossly inconsistent with ``standard'' stellar mass spectra. In particular, although there are structural differences between the detailed ONC mass spectrum and various models constructed from solar neighborhood data, the observed mass spectrum appears to a peak at ~ 0.2 M_&sun; and to fall off rapidly towards lower masses; several substellar objects are present. The abundance of low-mass stars relative to high-mass stars suggests that there is no bi-modal star formation mode; somewhat ironically, the ONC probably contains fractionally more low-mass stars than the solar neighborhood since the population not yet located on the HR diagram is dominated by sub-solar-mass stars. Nonetheless, the ONC mass spectrum is biased towards higher-mass stars within the innermost cluster radii (rprojected < 0.3 pc). We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mean age of < 1 Myr and an age spread which is probably less than 2 Myr, but also by a bias towards younger stars at smaller projected cluster radii. Although the most massive stars and the youngest stars are found preferentially towards the center of the ONC it does not follow that the most massive stars are the youngest stars. A lower limit to the total cluster mass in stars is Mstars ~ 900 M_&sun; (probably a factor of < 2 underestimate). A lower limit to the recent star formation rate is ~ 10(-4) M_&sun; yr(-1) . All observational data in this study as well as stellar parameters derived from them are available in electronic format.},

	Abstract = {Using the results of our first paper on the Chandra HRC observation of the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC), we explore the relation between the coronal activity of its 1 Myr-old pre-main-sequence population and stellar parameters. We find that median X-ray luminosities of low-mass stars (M/Msolar<~3) increase with increasing mass and decreasing stellar age. Brown dwarfs (0.03<~M/Msolar<~0.08) follow the same trend with mass. From M~0.1 to M~0.5 Msolar, median LX/Lbol values increase by about half an order of magnitude and then remain constant at ~10-3.5 for the mass range from 0.5 to 3.0 M/Msolar. In these same two mass ranges, LX/Lbol remains roughly constant with age, until it drops by more than 2 orders of magnitudes at the epoch when ~2-4 Msolar stars are expected to become fully radiative. We find a dependence of LX and LX/Lbol on circumstellar accretion indicators and suggest three possible hypotheses for its origin. In spite of improved X-ray and rotational data, correlations between activity indicators and rotation remain elusive for these stars, possibly indicating that stars for which rotational periods have been measured have reached some saturation level. Our study of X-ray activity versus stellar mass leads us to propose that the few HRC X-ray sources not associated with any optical/infrared counterpart trace a yet-to-be-discovered stellar population of deeply embedded, relatively massive ONC members.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Optical and X-ray emission from classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) has long been known to be highly variable. Our long, uninterrupted optical observation of the NGC 2264 region with CoRoT [The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programs, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.] allows the optical variability in CTTS to be studied with unprecedented accuracy and time coverage. Two short Chandra observations obtained during the CoRoT pointing with a separation of 16 days allow us to study whether there is a correlation between optical and X-ray variability on this timescale, thus probing the physical mechanisms driving the variability in both bands.  Methods: We have computed the optical and X-ray fractional variability between the two 30 ks duration windows covered by both the Chandra and CoRoT observations, for a sample of classical and weak line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) in NGC 2264. A scatter plot clearly shows that the variability of CTTSs in the optical and soft X-ray (0.5-1.5 keV) bands is correlated, while no correlation is apparent in the hard (1.5-8.0 keV) band. Also, no correlation in either band is present for WTTSs.  Results: We show that the correlation between soft X-ray and optical variability of CTTSs can be naturally explained in terms of time-variable shading (absorption) from circumstellar material orbiting the star, in a scenario rather similar to the one invoked to explain the observed phenomenology in the CTTS AA Tau. The slope of the observed correlation implies (in the hypothesis of homogeneous shading) a significant dust depletion in the circumstellar material (with a gas-to-dust ratio approximately 5 times lower than the standard value for interstellar material).},

	Abstract = {We present the results of dust continuum and molecular line observations of two massive cluster-forming clumps, NGC 2264-C and NGC 2264-D, including extensive mapping performed with the MAMBO bolometer array and the HERA heterodyne array on the IRAM 30 m telescope. Both NGC 2264 clumps are located in the Mon OB1 giant molecular cloud complex, adjacent to one another. Twelve and fifteen compact millimeter continuum sources (i.e. MMSs) were identified in clumps C and D, respectively. These MMSs have larger sizes and masses than the millimeter continuum condensations detected in well-known nearby protoclusters such as rho Ophiuchi. The MMSs of NGC 2264 are closer in size to the DCO+ "cores" of rho Oph, although they are somewhat denser and exhibit broader linewidths. Most of the MMSs of NGC 2264-C harbor candidate Class 0 protostars associated with shocked molecular hydrogen jets. Evidence of widespread infall motions was found in, e.g., HCO^+(3-2) or CS(3-2) in both NGC 2264-C and NGC 2264-D. A sharp velocity discontinuity  2 km s-1 in amplitude was observed in N2H^+(1-0) and H13CO^+(1-0) in the central, innermost part of NGC 2264-C, which we interpreted as the signature of a strong dynamical interaction between two MMSs and their possible merging with the central MMS C-MM3. Radiative transfer modelling supports the idea that NGC 2264-C is a highly unstable prolate clump in the process of collapsing along its long axis on a near free-fall dynamical timescale  1.7 × 10 5 yr. Our model fit of this large-scale collapse suggests a maximum mass inflow rate  3× 10-3 M&sun; yr-1 toward the central protostellar object C-MM3. In NGC 2264-D, we estimated a mass infall rate dot{M}_DMM1 ˜ 1.1 × 10 -4 M&sun; yr-1 toward the rotating Class 0 object D-MM1, also based on radiative transfer modelling of the observations. Such infall rates are sufficiently high to overcome radiation pressure and allow the formation of  20 M&sun; stars by accretion in  1.7× 105 yr, i.e., a time that is similar to the global dynamical timescale of the central part of NGC 2264-C. We conclude that we are likely witnessing the formation of a high-mass (⪆10 M&sun;) protostar in the central part of NGC 2264-C. Our results suggest a picture of massive star formation intermediate between the scenario of stellar mergers of Bonnell et al. (1998) and the massive turbulent core model of McKee & Tan (2003), whereby a turbulent, massive ultra-dense core is formed by the gravitational merger of two or more Class 0 protostellar cores at the center of a collapsing protocluster.},

A dense microcluster of seven Class 0 sources was detected in a 20''×20'' region with masses between 0.4 and 1.2 Msolar and deconvolved sizes of ~600 AU. We interpret the 1.3 mm emission as arising from the envelopes of the Class 0 protostellar sources. The mean separation of the 11 known sources (SMA Class 0 and previously known infrared sources) within D-MM1 is considerably smaller than the characteristic spacing between sources in the larger Spokes cluster and is consistent with hierarchical thermal fragmentation of the dense molecular gas in this region.},

Observations at 24 mum with the Multiband Imaging Photometer have enabled us to identify the most highly embedded and youngest objects in NGC 2264. This Letter reports on one particular region of NGC 2264 where bright 24 mum sources are spatially configured in curious linear structures with quasi-uniform separations. The majority of these sources (~60%) are found to be protostellar in nature, with Class I spectral energy distributions. Comparison of their spatial distribution with submillimeter data from Wolf-Chase et al. and millimeter data from Peretto et al. shows a close correlation between the dust filaments and the linear spatial configurations of the protostars, indicating that star formation is occurring primarily within dense, dusty filaments. Finally, the quasi-uniform separations of the protostars are found to be comparable in magnitude to the expected Jeans length, suggesting thermal fragmentation of the dense filamentary material.},

The submillimeter source IRAS 12 S1, previously believed to be an intermediate-mass Class 0 object is shown to be a dense collection of embedded, low-mass stars. We argue that this group of stars represents the fragmenting collapse of a dense, turbulent core, using a number of indicators of extreme youth. With reasonable estimates for the velocity dispersion in the group, we estimate a dynamical lifetime of only a few times 104 yr. Spectral energy distributions of stars in the core are consistent with Class I or Class 0 assignments. We present observations of an extensive system of molecular hydrogen emission knots. The luminosity of the objects in the core region are consistent with roughly solar mass protostars.},

	Abstract = {We summarize the results of an observing campaign to identify periodic pre-main-sequence (PMS) variables in the NGC 2264 OB association. We find 201 periodic candidates. The mean age of the NGC 2264 periodic variables is approximately 30% greater than their counterparts in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Given the difference in mean age between NGC 2264 and Orion, we expect the typical periodic variable in NGC 2264 to have a period shorter by a factor of ~1.6, if the initial distribution of periods in the two clusters is identical and if stellar angular momentum is conserved. However, we find a period distribution indistinguishable from that found in Orion. This suggests that the angular momenta of a significant fraction of PMS stars in the age range ~0.4 to ~4 Myr must be regulated. To examine the hypothesis that disk locking regulates PMS star angular momenta, we use four different disk indicators (U-V, IC-Ks, H-Ks, and Halpha) to search for correlations between period and disk indicator. We find no conclusive evidence that more slowly rotating stars have disk indicators, or that faster rotating stars are less likely to have disk indicators.},

	Abstract = {We present an optical and near-infrared study of a 45'×45' field in NGC 2264, which includes both S Mon and the Cone Nebula. We report photometry at optical (UBVRCIC) and near-infrared (JHK) wavelengths for ~5600 stars and spectroscopic classifications for ~400 of these stars. We identify circumstellar disk candidates using three techniques: excess ultraviolet (U-V) emission, excess near-IR (I-K and H-K) emission, and Halpha emission-line equivalent widths for those stars with spectra. We find generally good correlation between disk indicators thought to originate from different physical processes. We find little if any evolution of disk fraction with stellar age or mass. However, when we derive mass accretion rates (M) from the excess emission at U, we find that M decreases with age over the age range spanned by our data, ~0.1-5 Myr, and increases with mass over the range ~0.25-1 Msolar. These findings are comparable to results found previously by us in the Orion Nebula cluster flanking fields.},

	Abstract = {UBVRI Halpha CCD photometry has been obtained for the young open cluster NGC 2264. Using (R -Halpha) color, a measure of Halpha emission, we selected member stars in the pre-main-sequence (PMS) stage. The reliability of the (R -Halpha) color as a PMS star selection criterion was critically evaluated from their spatial distribution, near-IR photometric data and spectroscopic characteristics. By constructing the HR diagram, we determined the typical age and age spread of NGC 2264. Some discussions on the age discrepancy between turn-off age and turn-on age in a cluster were made. The shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of NGC 2264 is very similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster, but the surface density is far lower than that of NGC 6231 or the Orion Nebula Cluster. By assuming that the thickness (or amount of mass) of the circumstellar shell is linearly proportional to the strength of the Halpha emission Delta (R - Halpha) (≡ (R -Halpha)* - ( R - Halpha)MS), it can be concluded that the amount of material in the circumstellar shell is not the main source of spread in magnitude due to the lack of correlation between Delta(R - Halpha) and DeltaMv (≡Mv*-MtV=2 Myr).},

	Abstract = {NGC 2264 is a young Galactic cluster and the dominant component of the Mon OB1 association lying approximately 760 pc distant within the local spiral arm. The cluster is hierarchically structured, with subclusters of suspected members spread across several parsecs. Associated with the cluster is an extensive molecular cloud complex spannin= g more than two degrees on the sky. The combined mass of the remaining molecular cloud core= s upon which the cluster is superposed is estimated to be at least ˜3.7×10^{4} M_{&sun;}. Star formation is ongoing within the region as evidenced by the presence of numerous embedded clusters of protostars, molecular outflows, and Herbig-Haro objects. The stellar population of NGC 2264 is dominated by the O7 V multiple star, S Mon, and several dozen B-type zero-age main sequence stars. X-ray imaging surveys, Halpha emission surveys, and photometric variability studies have identified more than 600 intermediate and low-mass members distributed throughout the molecular cloud complex, but concentrated within two densely populated areas between S Mon and the Cone Nebula. Estimates for the total stellar population of the cluster range as high as 1000 members and limited deep photometric surveys have identified ˜230 substellar mass candidates. The median age of NGC 2264 is estimated to be ˜3 Myr by fitting various pre-main sequence isochrones to the low-mass stellar population, but an apparent age dispersion of at least ˜5 Myr can be inferred from the broadened sequence of suspected members. Infrared and millimeter observations of the cluster have identified two prominent sites of star formation activity centered nea= r NGC 2264 IRS1, a deeply embedded early-type (B2-B5) star, and IRS2, a star forming core and associated protostellar cluster. NGC 2264 and its associated molecular clouds have been extensively examined at all wavelengths, from the centimeter regime to X-rays. Given it= s relative proximity, well-defined stellar population, and low foreground extinction, the cluster will remain a prime candidate for star formation studies throughout the foreseeable future.},

	Abstract = {The extreme outer Galaxy (EOG), the region with a Galactic radius of more than 18 kpc, is known to have a very low metallicity, about one-tenth that of the solar neighborhood. We obtained the deep near-infrared (NIR) images of two very young (~0.5 Myr) star-forming clusters that are two of the most distant embedded clusters in the EOG. We find that in both clusters the fraction of stars with NIR excess, which originates from the circumstellar dust disk at radii of <=0.1 AU, is significantly lower than those in the solar neighborhood. Our results suggest that most of the stars forming in the low-metallicity environment experience disk dispersal at an earlier stage (<1 Myr) than those forming in the solar metallicity environment (as much as ~5-6 Myr). Such a rapid disk dispersal may make the formation of planets difficult, and the shorter disk lifetime with a lower metallicity, could contribute to the strong metallicity dependence of the well-known "planet-metallicity correlation," which states that the probability of a star hosting a planet increases steeply with stellar metallicity. The reason for the rapid disk dispersal could be the increase of the mass accretion rate and/or the effective far-ultraviolet photoevaporation due to the low extinction; however, another unknown mechanism for the EOG environment could be contributing significantly.

	Abstract = {Photoevaporation driven by the central star is expected to be a ubiquitous and important mechanism for dispersing the circumstellar dust and gas from which planets form. Here, we present a detailed study of the circumstellar disk surrounding the nearby star TW Hya and provide observational constraints to its photoevaporative wind. Our new high-resolution (R ~ 30,000) mid-infrared spectroscopy in the [Ne II] 12.81 mum line confirms that this gas diagnostic traces the unbound wind component within 10 AU of the star. From the blueshift and asymmetry in the line profile, we estimate that most (>80%) of the [Ne II] emission arises from disk radii where the midplane is optically thick to the redshifted outflowing gas, meaning beyond the 1 or 4 AU dust rim inferred from other observations. We re-analyze high-resolution (R ~ 48,000) archival optical spectra searching for additional transitions that may trace the photoevaporative flow. Unlike the [Ne II] line, optical forbidden lines from O I, S II, and Mg I are centered at stellar velocity and have symmetric profiles. The only way these lines can trace the photoevaporative flow is if they arise from a disk region physically distinct from that traced by the [Ne II] line, specifically from within the optically thin dust gap. However, the small (~10 km s-1) FWHM of these lines suggests that most of the emitting gas traced at optical wavelengths is bound to the system rather than unbound. We discuss the implications of our results for a planet-induced gap versus a photoevaporation-induced gap.

	Abstract = {Ices regulate much of the chemistry during star formation and account for up to 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in a H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freeze-out levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation and formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances are consistent with with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin.},

	Abstract = {Aims. We present a study of the distribution of stellar ages in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on accurate HST photometry taken from the HST Treasury Program observations of the ONC utilizing the most recent estimate of the cluster's distance (Menten et al. 2007). We investigate the presence of an intrinsic age spread in the region and a possible trend of age with the spatial distribution. Methods. We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity towards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical calibration of atmospheric models (Da Rio et al. 2010) using the package Chorizos (Maiz-Apellaniz 2004). The position of the sources in the HR-diagram is compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster age and age dispersion. Through Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the amount of intrinsic age spread in the region, taking into account uncertainties on the distance, spectral type, extinction, unresolved binaries, accretion and photometric variability. Results. According to Siess et al. (2000) evolutionary models the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myrs. With Monte Carlo simulations we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent with a coeval stellar population, but is in agreement with a star formation activity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myrs. We also observe light evidence for a trend of ages with spatial distribution.},

	Abstract = {We present the first pilot study of jets from young stars conducted with X-shooter, on the ESO/Very Large Telescope. As it offers simultaneous, high-quality spectra in the range 300-2500 nm, X-shooter is uniquely important for spectral diagnostics in jet studies. We chose to probe the accretion/ejection mechanisms at low stellar masses examining two targets with well-resolved continuous jets lying on the plane of the sky: ESO-HA 574 in Chameleon I and Par-Lup3-4 in Lupus III. The mass of the latter is close to the sub-stellar boundary (M sstarf = 0.13 M sun). A large number of emission lines probing regions of different excitation are identified, position-velocity diagrams are presented, and mass outflow/accretion rates are estimated. Comparison between the two objects is striking. ESO-HA 574 is a weakly accreting star for which we estimate a mass accretion rate of log (\dot{M}_{acc}) = -10.8 +/- 0.5 (in M sun yr--1), yet it drives a powerful jet with \dot{M}_{out} ~ 1.5-2.7 × 10--9 M sun yr--1. These values can be reconciled with a magneto-centrifugal jet acceleration mechanism assuming that the presence of the edge-on disk severely depresses the luminosity of the accretion tracers. In comparison, Par-Lup3-4, with stronger mass accretion (log (\dot{M}_{acc}) = -9.1 +/- 0.4 M sun yr--1), drives a low-excitation jet with about \dot{M}_{out} ~ 3.2 × 10--10 M sun yr--1 in both lobes. Despite the low stellar mass, \dot{M}_{out}/\dot{M}_{acc} for Par-Lup3-4 is at the upper limit of the range usually measured for young objects, but still compatible with a steady magneto-centrifugal wind scenario if all uncertainties are considered.  Based on Observations collected with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal (Chile), operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Program ID: 085.C-0238(A).},

	Abstract = {The young open cluster NGC 2264 was observed on 2002 January 6-7 with the CFH12K mosaic CCD on the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to investigate the shape of the initial mass function (IMF). In order to select the pre-main-sequence (PMS) members more completely, Chandra X-Ray Observatory archival data were retrieved and used for the identification of X-ray-emitting weak-line T Tauri stars. In addition, the (R-I,V-I) diagram was used to exclude background late-type giants, and a statistical approach was applied to estimate the number of contaminating foreground main-sequence stars. The shape of the IMF of the Chandra field of view is flat between logm=-0.4 and ~-1.0 (m in solar mass units), with a weak signature of a dip near logm=-0.2. The overall shape of the IMF is very similar to those obtained for the Pleiades or the Trapezium. The fraction of disked PMS stars, as noted by Rebull and coworkers, does not show any signature of mass dependency. The age of PMS stars between logm=0 and -1 is 3.1+/-0.5 Myr.},

	Abstract = {We report on a sequence of Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of the TW Hydrae brown dwarf (BD) 2MASSW J1139511--315921 (2M1139). In the combined 31 ks ACIS-S exposure, 2M1139 is detected at the 3sigma confidence level. We find an X-ray luminosity of L X = 1.4+2.7 -- 1.0 × 1026 erg s--1 or log L X/L bol = --4.8 $\pm$ 0.3. This object is similar to another TW Hydrae BD member, CD-33 7795B (TWA 5B): both have Halpha emission, both show no signatures of accretion, and both have comparable ages and spectral types. TWA 5B was previously detected in X-rays with a luminosity of L X = 4 × 1027 erg s--1 or log L X/L bol = --3.4, an order of magnitude more luminous in X-rays than 2M1139. We find that the discrepancy between the X-ray luminosity of 2M1139 and TWA 5B is consistent with the spread in X-ray luminosity in the Orion Nebula Cluster for BDs of similar spectral types. Though rotation may play a role in the X-ray activity of ultracool dwarfs like 2M1139 and TWA 5B, the discrepancy cannot be explained by rotation alone. We also examine two X-ray bright objects in the field of view of our Chandra observations and find one to be of spectral type K0IV and identify it as a possible RS Canum Venaticorum, and another X-ray bright object whose light curve clearly shows the decay phase of an X-ray flare.},

	Abstract = {Low-mass protostars may accrete most of their material through short-lived episodes of rapid disk accretion; yet until recently evolutionary tracks for these protostars assumed only constant or slowly-varying accretion. Important initial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion were recently made by Baraffe, Chabrier, & Gallardo, who showed that in the limit of low-temperature ("cold") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii than found in previous treatments. Such small radii at the end of protostellar accretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older - perhaps as much as 10 Myr - than they really are. However, we argue that very rapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of the best-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - the FU Ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, not small, protostellar radii. In addition, theory indicates models that at high accretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometrically thick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. In addition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely to irradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers and potentially expanding them. Nevertheless, the Baraffe et al. calculations emphasize the importance of initial protostellar radii for subsequent evolution.},

	Abstract = {Aims:To study the X-ray properties of young stellar objects (YSOs), we analyze an exceptionally sensitive Chandra dataset of the Coronet cluster in the CrA star-forming region, achieving a limiting luminosity of L_X,min ˜ 5× 1026 erg/s for lightly absorbed sources. This dataset represents one of the most sensitive X-ray observations ever obtained of a star-forming region.   Methods: The X-ray data are used to investigate the membership status of tentative members of the region, to derive plasma temperatures and X-ray luminosities of the YSOs, and to investigate variability on the timescale of several years.   Results: 46 of the 92 X-ray sources in the merged Chandra image can be identified with optical or near/mid-infrared counterparts. X-ray emission is detected from all of the previously known optically visible late-type (spectral types G to M) stellar cluster members, from five of the eight brown dwarf candidates, and from nine embedded objects (``protostars'') with class 0, class I, or flat-spectrum spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) in the field of view. While the Herbig Ae/Be stars TY CrA and R CrA, a close companion of the B9e star HD 176386, and the F0e star T CrA are detected, no X-ray emission is found from any of the Herbig-Haro (HH) objects or the protostellar cores without infrared source. We find indications for diffuse X-ray emission near R CrA / IRS 7.   Conclusions: The observed X-ray properties of the Coronet YSOs are consistent with coronal activity; soft spectral components hinting towards X-ray emission from accretion shocks were not found. The X-ray emission of the AeBe stars TY CrA and HD 176386 probably originates from close late-type companions. The Ae star R CrA shows a peculiar X-ray spectrum and an extremely hot plasma temperature. Finally, we discuss the differences of the X-ray properties of YSOs in different evolutionary stages.

	Abstract = {We report here results of spectropolarimetric observations of the ~8Myr classical TTauri star (cTTS) TWHya carried out with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) in the framework of the `Magnetic Protostars and Planets' (MaPP) programme, and obtained at 2 different epochs (2008 March and 2010 March). Obvious Zeeman signatures are detected at all times, both in photospheric lines and in accretion-powered emission lines. Significant intrinsic variability and moderate rotational modulation is observed in both photospheric and accretion proxies. Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of the photospheric brightness and of the accretion-powered emission at the surface of TWHya at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly poloidal and axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis of the star, and that the octupolar component of the large-scale field (2.5-2.8kG at the pole) largely dominates the dipolar component. This large-scale field topology is characteristic of partly-convective stars, supporting the conclusion (from evolutionary models) that TWHya already hosts a radiative core. We also show that TWHya features a high-latitude photospheric cool spot overlapping with the main magnetic pole (and producing the observed radial velocity fluctuations); this is also where accretion concentrates most of the time, although accretion at lower latitudes is found to occur episodically. We propose that the relatively rapid rotation of TWHya (with respect to AATau-like cTTSs) directly reflects the weakness of the large-scale dipole, no longer capable of magnetically disrupting the accretion disc up to the corotation radius (at which the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation period). We therefore conclude that TWHya is in a phase of rapid spin-up as its large-scale dipole field progressively vanishes.},

	Abstract = {Whether protoplanetary disks accrete at observationally significant rates by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) depends on how well ionized they are. Disk surface layers ionized by stellar X-rays are susceptible to charge neutralization by small condensates, ranging from ~0.01 mum sized grains to angstrom-sized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Ion densities in X-ray-irradiated surfaces are so low that ambipolar diffusion weakens the MRI. Here we show that ionization by stellar far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation enables full-blown MRI turbulence in disk surface layers. Far-UV ionization of atomic carbon and sulfur produces a plasma so dense that it is immune to ion recombination on grains and PAHs. The FUV-ionized layer, of thickness 0.01-0.1 g cm--2, behaves in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit and can accrete at observationally significant rates at radii >~ 1-10 AU. Surface layer accretion driven by FUV ionization can reproduce the trend of increasing accretion rate with increasing hole size seen in transitional disks. At radii lsim1-10 AU, FUV-ionized surface layers cannot sustain the accretion rates generated at larger distance, and unless turbulent mixing of plasma can thicken the MRI-active layer, an additional means of transport is needed. In the case of transitional disks, it could be provided by planets.},

	Abstract = {Context. Protoplanetary disks generally exhibit strong line emission from the CO fundamental v = 1-0 ro-vibrational band around 4.7 mum. The lines are usually interpreted as being formed in the Keplerian disk, as opposed to other kinematic components of the young stellar system.  Aims: This paper investigates a set of disks that show CO emission line profiles characterized by a single, narrow peak and a broad base extending to >50 km s-1, not readily explained by just Keplerian motions of gas in the inner disk.  Methods: High resolution (R = 105) M-band spectroscopy has been obtained using CRIRES at the Very Large Telescope in order to fully resolve fundamental ro-vibrational CO emission line profiles around 4.7 mum.  Results: Line profiles with a narrow peak and broad wings are found for 8 disks among a sample of ~50 disks around T Tauri stars with CO emission. The lines are very symmetric, have high line/continuum ratios and have central velocity shifts of < 5 km s-1 relative to the stellar radial velocity. The disks in this subsample are accreting onto their central stars at high rates relative to the parent sample. All 8 disks show CO emission lines from the v = 2 vibrational state and 4/8 disks show emission up to v = 4. Excitation analyses of the integrated line fluxes reveal a significant difference between typical rotational (~300-800 K) and vibrational (~1700 K) temperatures, suggesting that the lines are excited, at least in part, by UV-fluorescence. For at least one source, the narrow and broad components show different excitation temperatures, but generally the two component fits have similar central velocities and temperature. Analysis of their spatial distribution shows that the lines are formed within a few AU of the central star.  Conclusions: It is concluded that these broad centrally peaked line profiles are inconsistent with the double peaked profiles expected from just an inclined disk in Keplerian rotation. Models in which the low velocity emission arises from large disk radii are excluded based on the small spatial distribution. Alternative non-Keplerian line formation mechanisms are discussed, including thermally and magnetically launched winds and funnel flows. The most likely interpretation is that the broad-based centrally peaked line profiles originate from a combination of emission from the inner part (<a few AU) of a circumstellar disk, perhaps with enhanced turbulence, and a slow moving disk wind, launched by either EUV emission or soft X-rays.  This work is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope under program ID 179.C-0151.},

	Abstract = {Context: High spectral resolution X-ray observations of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) demonstrate the presence of plasma at temperature T˜ 2-3× 106 K and density n_e˜ 1011-1013 cm-3, which are unobserved in non-accreting stars. Stationary models suggest that this emission is due to shock-heated accreting material, but do not allow us to analyze the stability of the material and its position in the stellar atmosphere. Aims: We investigate the dynamics and stability of shock-heated accreting material in classical T Tauri stars and the role of the stellar chromosphere in determining the position and thickness of the shocked region.  Methods: We perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the impact of an accretion flow on the chromosphere of a CTTS, including the effects of gravity, radiative losses from optically thin plasma, thermal conduction and a well tested detailed model of the stellar chromosphere. We present the results of a simulation based on the parameters of the CTTS MP Mus.  Results: We find that the accretion shock generates an hot slab of material above the chromosphere with a maximum thickness of 1.8 × 109 cm, density n_e˜ 1011-1012 cm-3, temperature T˜ 3× 106 K, and uniform pressure equal to the ram pressure of the accretion flow (~450 dyn cm-2). The base of the shocked region penetrates the chromosphere and remains at a position at which the ram pressure is equal to the thermal pressure. The system evolves with quasi-periodic instabilities of the material in the slab leading to cyclic disappearance and re-formation of the slab. For an accretion rate of ~10-10~Mo yr-1, the shocked region emits a time-averaged X-ray luminosity of L_X≈ 7× 1029 erg s-1, which is comparable with the X-ray luminosity observed in CTTSs of identical mass. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum synthesized from the simulation reproduces in detail all the main features of the O VIII and O VII lines of the star MP Mus.},

	Abstract = {Context. High resolution X-ray observations of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) show a soft X-ray excess due to high density plasma (ne = 1011-113 cm-3). This emission has been attributed to shock-heated accreting material impacting onto the stellar surface.  Aims: We investigate the observability of the shock-heated accreting material in the X-ray band as a function of the accretion stream properties (velocity, density, and metal abundance) in the case of plasma-beta ≪ 1 (thermal pressure ≪ magnetic pressure) in the post-shock zone.  Methods: We use a 1-D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the chromosphere of a CTTS, including the effects of radiative cooling, gravity stratification and thermal conduction. We explore the space of relevant parameters and synthesize from the model results the X-ray emission in the [0.5-8.0] keV band and in the resonance lines of O vii (21.60 {\AA}) and Ne ix (13.45 {\AA}), taking into account the absorption from the chromosphere.  Results: The accretion stream properties largely influence the temperature and the stand-off height of the shocked slab and its sinking in the chromosphere, determining the observability of the shocked plasma affected by chromospheric absorption. Our model predicts that X-ray observations preferentially detect emission from low density and high velocity shocked accretion streams due to the large absorption of dense post-shock plasma. In all the cases examined, the post-shock zone exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations due to thermal instabilities with periods ranging from 3×10-2 to 4×103 s. In the case of inhomogeneous streams and beta ≪ 1, the shock oscillations are hardly detectable.  Conclusions: We suggest that, if accretion streams are inhomogeneous, the selection effect introduced by the absorption on observable plasma components may easily explain the discrepancy between the accretion rate measured by optical and X-ray data as well as the different densities measured using different He-like triplets in the X-ray band.},

	Abstract = {Sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photons collected with the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. PSR J1741-2054, with period P = 413 ms, was detected in archival Parkes telescope data and subsequently has been detected at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Its received flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a very small dispersion measure of DM = 4.7 pc cm-3, implying a distance of ≈0.4 kpc and possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. At this distance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1 GeV corresponds to 28% of the spin-down luminosity of \dot{E} = 9.4× 10^{33} erg s-1. The gamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely spaced peaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta = 0.29 P. We have also identified a soft Swift source that is the likely X-ray counterpart. In many respects PSR J1741-2054 resembles the Geminga pulsar. The second source, PSR J2032+4127, was detected at the GBT. It has P = 143 ms, and its DM = 115 pc cm-3 suggests a distance of ≈3.6 kpc, but we consider it likely that it is located within the Cyg OB2 stellar association at half that distance. The radio emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes by delta = 0.15 P the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated by Delta = 0.50 P. The second peak has a harder spectrum than the first one, following a trend observed in young gamma-ray pulsars. Faint, diffuse X-ray emission in a Chandra image is possibly its pulsar wind nebula. The wind of PSR J2032+4127 is responsible for the formerly unidentified HEGRA source TeV J2032+4130. PSR J2032+4127 is coincident in projection with MT91 213, a Be star in Cyg OB2, although apparently not a binary companion of it.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution X-ray spectra of the nearby multiple T Tauri star (TTS) system Hen 3-600, obtained with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrograph (HETGS) aboard the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Both principal binary components of Hen 3-600 (A and B, separation 1.4") were detected in the zeroth-order Chandra HETGS X-ray image. Hen 3-600-A, the component with a large mid-infrared excess, is a factor of ~2-3 fainter in X-rays than Hen 3-600-B, due to a large flare at Hen 3-600-B during our observation. The dispersed X-ray spectra of the two primary components overlap significantly, so spectral analysis was performed primarily on the first-order spectrum of the combined A + B system, with analysis of the individual dispersed spectra limited to regions where the contributions of A and B can be disentangled via cross-dispersion profile fitting. This analysis results in two lines of evidence indicating that the X-ray emission from Hen 3-600 A + B is derived, in part, from accretion processes. (1) The line ratios of He-like O VII in the spectrum of Hen 3-600 A + B indicate that the characteristic density of its X-ray-emitting plasma is significantly larger than those of coronally active main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars. (2) A significant component of low-temperature (2-3 MK) plasma is present in the Hen 3-600 A + B spectrum; this ``soft excess'' appears somewhat stronger in component A. These results for Hen 3-600 A + B are consistent with, although less pronounced than, results obtained from X-ray grating spectroscopy of more rapidly accreting TTS systems. Indeed, all of the emission signatures of Hen 3-600 A + B that are potential diagnostics of accretion activity-from its high-resolution X-ray spectrum, through its UV excess and Halpha emission-line strengths, to its weak near-infrared excess-suggest that its components (and component A in particular) represent a transition phase between rapidly accreting, classical T Tauri stars and nonaccreting, weak-lined T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We present the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP) X-ray point source catalog with ~6800 X-ray sources detected in 149 Chandra observations covering ~10 deg2. The full ChaMP catalog sample is 7 times larger than the initial published ChaMP catalog. The exposure time of the fields in our sample ranges from 0.9 to 124 ks, corresponding to a deepest X-ray flux limit of f0.5-8.0=9×10-16 ergs cm-2 s-1. The ChaMP X-ray data have been uniformly reduced and analyzed with ChaMP-specific pipelines and then carefully validated by visual inspection. The ChaMP catalog includes X-ray photometric data in eight different energy bands as well as X-ray spectral hardness ratios and colors. To best utilize the ChaMP catalog, we also present the source reliability, detection probability, and positional uncertainty. To quantitatively assess those parameters, we performed extensive simulations. In particular, we present a set of empirical equations: the flux limit as a function of effective exposure time and the positional uncertainty as a function of source counts and off-axis angle. The false source detection rate is ~1% of all detected ChaMP sources, while the detection probability is better than ~95% for sources with counts >~30 and off-axis angle <5'. The typical positional offset between ChaMP X-ray source and their SDSS optical counterparts is 0.7''+/-0.4'', derived from ~900 matched sources.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP) is a wide-area (~14 deg2) survey of serendipitous Chandra X-ray sources, aiming to establish fair statistical samples covering a wide range of characteristics (such as absorbed active galactic nuclei, high-z clusters of galaxies) at flux levels (fX~10-15to10-14 ergs s-1 cm-2) intermediate between the Chandra deep surveys and previous missions. We present the first ChaMP catalog, which consists of 991 near on-axis, bright X-ray sources obtained from the initial sample of 62 observations. The data have been uniformly reduced and analyzed with techniques specifically developed for the ChaMP and then validated by visual examination. To assess source reliability and positional uncertainty, we perform a series of simulations and also use Chandra data to complement the simulation study. The false source detection rate is found to be as good as or better than expected for a given limiting threshold. On the other hand, the chance of missing a real source is rather complex, depending on the source counts, off-axis distance (or PSF), and background rate. The positional error (95% confidence level) is usually less than 1" for a bright source, regardless of its off-axis distance, while it can be as large as 4" for a weak source (~20 counts) at a large off-axis distance (Doff-axis>8'). We have also developed new methods to find spatially extended or temporary variable sources, and those sources are listed in the catalog.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical study of the X-ray emission toward 22 Herbig AeBe stars (HAEBE) using the Chandra archive. We probe the origin of the X-rays toward Herbig stars: are they intrinsic?This question is addressed by correlations between the physical stellar properties and the X-ray emission. There is a weak correlation between the continuum radio emission at lambda = 3.6 cm and L X, which suggests that the X-ray emission depends upon the source. On the other hand, no correlation was found with the stellar rotational period, but that only excludes solar-like magnetic activity as the origin of the X-rays. Most importantly, the X-ray luminosity of HAEBE has a different distribution from that of T Tauri stars, suggesting that X-ray emission from an unseen late-type star companion can be ruled out with an 80% confidence level. This implies that the HAEBE must have magnetic activity. In addition, we report the observation of five sources for the first time, in three detections.},

	Abstract = {Context. High resolution X-ray spectroscopy has revealed soft X-rays from high density plasma in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), probably arising from the accretion shock region. However, the mass accretion rates derived from the X-ray observations are consistently lower than those derived from UV/optical/NIR studies.  Aims: We aim to test the hypothesis that the high density soft X-ray emission originates from accretion by analysing, in a homogeneous manner, optical accretion indicators for an X-ray selected sample of CTTSs.  Methods: We analyse optical spectra of the X-ray selected sample of CTTSs and calculate the accretion rates based on measuring the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, He ii 4686 {\AA}, He i 5016 {\AA}, He i 5876 {\AA}, O i 6300 {\AA}, and He i 6678 {\AA} equivalent widths. In addition, we also calculate the accretion rates based on the full width at 10% maximum of the Halpha line. The different optical tracers of accretion are compared and discussed. The derived accretion rates are then compared to the accretion rates derived from the X-ray spectroscopy.  Results: We find that, for each CTTS in our sample, the different optical tracers predict mass-accretion rates that agree within the errors, albeit with a spread of ≈ 1 order of magnitude. Typically, mass-accretion rates derived from Halpha and He i 5876 {\AA} are larger than those derived from Hbeta, Hgamma, and O i. In addition, the Halpha full width at 10%, whilst a good indicator of accretion, may not accurately measure the mass-accretion rate. When the optical mass-accretion rates are compared to the X-ray derived mass-accretion rates, we find that: a) the latter are always lower (but by varying amounts); b) the latter range within a factor of ≈ 2 around 2 × 10-10 Mo yr-1, despite the former spanning a range of ≈ 3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that the systematic underestimate of the X-ray derived mass-accretion rates could depend on the density distribution inside the accretion streams, where the densest part of the stream is not visible in the X-ray band because of the absorption by the stellar atmosphere. We also suggest that a non-negligible optical depth of X-ray emission lines produced by post-shock accreting plasma may explain the almost constant mass-accretion rates derived in X-rays if the effect is larger in stars with higher optical mass-accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {Context. The soft X-ray emission from high density plasma observed in several CTTS is usually associated with the accretion process. However, it is still unclear whether this high density "cool" plasma is heated in the accretion shock, or if it is coronal plasma fed or modified by the accretion process.  Aims: We conducted a coordinated quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observing campaign of the CTTS V2129 Oph. In this paper, we analyze Chandra grating spectrometer data and attempt to correlate the observed X-ray emitting plasma components with the characteristics of the accretion process and the stellar magnetic field constrained by simultaneous optical observations.  Methods: We analyze a 200 ks Chandra/HETGS observation, subdivided into two 100 ks segments, of the CTTS V2129 Oph. For the two observing segments corresponding to two different phases within one stellar rotation, we measure the density of the cool plasma component and the emission measure distribution.  Results: The X-ray emitting plasma covers a wide range of temperatures: from 2 up to 34 MK. The cool plasma component of V2129 Oph (T ≈ 3-4 MK) varies between the two segments of the Chandra observation: during the first observing segment high density plasma (log Ne = 12.1+0.6_{-1.1}) with high EM at  3-4 MK is present, whereas, during the second segment, this plasma component has lower EM and lower density (log Ne < 11.5), although the statistical significance of these differences is marginal. Hotter plasma components, T >= 10 MK, vary on short timescales ( 10 ks), which are typical of coronal plasma. A clear flare, detected during the first segment, might be located in a large coronal loop (half length >3 R*).  Conclusions: Our observation provides additional confirmation that the dense cool plasma at a few MK in CTTS is material heated in the accretion shock. The variability of this cool plasma component on V2129 Oph may be explained in terms of X-rays emitted in the accretion shock and seen with different viewing angles at the two rotational phases probed by our observation. In particular, during the first time interval a direct view of the shock region is possible, while, during the second, the accretion funnel itself intersects the line of sight to the shock region, preventing us from observing the accretion-driven X-rays.},

	Abstract = {We address the question of whether protoplanetary discs around low mass stars (e.g. M-dwarfs) may be longer lived than their solar-type counterparts. This question is particularly relevant to assess the planet-making potential of these lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young stars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial distribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of disc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference between the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest neighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older population should appear more spread out. To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial distribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low mass star forming regions. We find no evidence for significant age differences between the disc-bearing low-mass (later than M2) and 'solar-type' (earlier than M2) stars in these regions. We model our results by constructing and analysing synthetic fractal distributions that we evolve for typical values of the velocity dispersions. A comparison of simple models to our MST analysis suggests that the lifetime of discs around M-stars is similar to that of discs around solar-type stars. Furthermore, a model-independent spatial analysis of the observations robustly shows that any age differences between the two samples must be smaller than the average age difference between disc-bearing classical T-Tauri stars and disc-less Weak-Lined T-Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {Based on the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) observation, we establish the global X-ray properties of the stellar population associated with the Orion Nebula. Three components contribute roughly equally to the integrated COUP luminosity in the hard (2-8 keV) X-ray band: several OB stars, 822 lightly obscured cool stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and 559 heavily obscured stars. ONC stars 0.5-2 pc from the center show a spatial asymmetry consistent with violent relaxation in the stellar dynamics. The obscured COUP sources concentrate around both OMC-1 molecular cores; these small-scale structures indicate ages t<~0.1 Myr. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the lightly obscured sample is roughly lognormal in shape. The obscured population is deficient in lower luminosity stars, perhaps due to localized circumstellar material. Mass-stratified XLFs show that one-third of the Orion Nebula region hard-band emission is produced by the bright O6 star theta1 Ori C and half is produced by lower mass pre-main-sequence stars with masses 0.3 Msolar<M<3 Msolar. Very low mass stars contribute little to the cluster X-ray emission. Using the hard band emission, we show that young stellar clusters like the ONC can be readily detected and resolved with Chandra across the Galactic disk, even in the presence of heavy obscuration. The Orion Nebula sample is a valuable template for studies of distant clusters. For example, the peak of the XLF shape can serve as a standard candle for a new distance measure to distant young stellar clusters, and the presence of a neon emission line complex around 1 keV can serve as a diagnostic for young stars.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of photometrically variable stars discovered within two 21farcm3 × 21farcm3 fields centered on the Cygnus OB2 association (Cyg OB2). There have hitherto been no deep optical variability studies of Cyg OB2, despite it being replete with early-type massive stars, likely due to the high and variable extinction (up to AV ≈ 20) that permeates much of the region. Here, we provide results of the first variability study with this combination of spatial coverage (~0.5 deg) and photometric depth (R ~ 21 mag). We find 121 stars to be variable in both R and I bands, 115 of them newly discovered. Of the 121 variables, we identify 27 eclipsing binaries and eclipsing-binary candidates, 52 pulsating variables, and 20 potential Herbig Ae/Be stars. Confirming both the status and the cluster membership of the Herbig Ae/Be stars would address the uncertainty regarding the age and star formation history of Cyg OB2. We match our catalog to known variables and binaries in the region, Two Micron All Sky Survey near-IR data, and Chandra X-ray observations to find counterparts to new variables in other wavelengths.  Based on observations obtained using the 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescope at the MDM Observatory.},

Thousands of faint X-ray sources are found, many concentrated into rich young stellar clusters. However, significant contamination from unrelated Galactic and extragalactic sources is present in the X-ray catalog. We describe the use of a naive Bayes classifier to assign membership probabilities to individual sources, based on source location, X-ray properties, and visual/infrared properties. For the particular membership decision rule adopted, 75% of CCCP sources are classified as members, 11% are classified as contaminants, and 14% remain unclassified. The resulting sample of stars likely to be Carina members is used in several other studies, which appear in this special issue devoted to the CCCP.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of young stars found in the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP) is examined for clustering structure. X-ray surveys are advantageous for identifying young stellar populations compared to optical and infrared surveys in suffering less contamination from nebular emission and Galactic field stars. The analysis is based on smoothed maps of a spatially complete subsample of ~3000 brighter X-ray sources classified as Carina members and ~10,000 stars from the full CCCP sample. The principal known clusters are recovered, and some additional smaller groups are identified. No rich embedded clusters are present, although a number of sparse groups are found. The CCCP reveals considerable complexity in clustering properties. The Trumpler 14 and 15 clusters have rich stellar populations in unimodal, centrally concentrated structures several parsecs across. Non-spherical internal structure is seen, and large-scale low surface density distributions surround these rich clusters. Trumpler 16, in contrast, is comprised of several smaller clusters within a circular boundary. Collinder 228 is a third type of cluster which extends over tens of parsecs with many sparse compact groups likely arising from triggered star formation processes. A widely dispersed, but highly populous, distribution of X-ray stars across the ~50 pc CCCP mosaic supports a model of past generations of star formation in the region. Collinder 234, a group of massive stars without an associated cluster of pre-main-sequence stars, may be part of this dispersed population.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 1439 young stellar objects (YSOs) spanning the 1.42 deg2 field surveyed by the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP), which includes the major ionizing clusters and the most active sites of ongoing star formation within the Great Nebula in Carina. Candidate YSOs were identified via infrared (IR) excess emission from dusty circumstellar disks and envelopes, using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope (the Vela-Carina survey) and the Two-Micron All Sky Survey. We model the 1-24 mum IR spectral energy distributions of the YSOs to constrain physical properties. Our Pan-Carina YSO Catalog (PCYC) is dominated by intermediate-mass (2 M sun < m <~ 10 M sun) objects with disks, including Herbig Ae/Be stars and their less evolved progenitors. The PCYC provides a valuable complementary data set to the CCCP X-ray source catalogs, identifying 1029 YSOs in Carina with no X-ray detection. We also catalog 410 YSOs with X-ray counterparts, including 62 candidate protostars. Candidate protostars with X-ray detections tend to be more evolved than those without. In most cases, X-ray emission apparently originating from intermediate-mass, disk-dominated YSOs is consistent with the presence of low-mass companions, but we also find that X-ray emission correlates with cooler stellar photospheres and higher disk masses. We suggest that intermediate-mass YSOs produce X-rays during their early pre-main-sequence evolution, perhaps driven by magnetic dynamo activity during the convective atmosphere phase, but this emission dies off as the stars approach the main sequence. Extrapolating over the stellar initial mass function scaled to the PCYC population, we predict a total population of >2 × 104 YSOs and a present-day star formation rate (SFR) of >0.008 M sun yr--1. The global SFR in the Carina Nebula, averaged over the past ~5 Myr, has been approximately constant.},

	Abstract = {We present a 1.42 deg2 mosaic of diffuse X-ray emission in the Great Nebula in Carina from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer camera. After removing >14,000 X-ray point sources from the field, we smooth the remaining unresolved emission, tessellate it into segments of similar apparent surface brightness, and perform X-ray spectral fitting on those tessellates to infer the intrinsic properties of the X-ray-emitting plasma. By modeling faint resolved point sources, we estimate the contribution to the extended X-ray emission from unresolved point sources and show that the vast majority of Carina's unresolved X-ray emission is truly diffuse. Line-like correlated residuals in the X-ray spectral fits suggest that substantial X-ray emission is generated by charge exchange at the interfaces between Carina's hot, rarefied plasma and its many cold neutral pillars, ridges, and clumps.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP) has shown that the Carina Nebula displays bright, spatially-complex soft diffuse X-ray emission. Here, we "sum up" the CCCP diffuse emission work by comparing the global morphology and spectrum of Carina's diffuse X-ray emission to other famous sites of massive star formation with pronounced diffuse X-ray emission: M17, NGC 3576, NGC 3603, and 30 Doradus. All spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasma components to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kT = 0.2-0.6 keV and a harder component with kT = 0.5-0.9 keV. In several cases these hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization that may indicate recent and current strong shocks. A cavity north of the embedded giant H II region NGC 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits hard diffuse X-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likely due to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar and a newly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. All of these targets exhibit X-ray emission lines that are not well modeled by variable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to charge exchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, X-ray-emitting plasma and cold, dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at the many hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {Context: T Tau stars display different X-ray properties depending on whether they are accreting (classical T Tau stars; CTTS) or not (weak-line T Tau stars; WTTS). X-ray properties may provide insight into the accretion process between disk and stellar surface.  Aims: We use data from the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus molecular cloud (XEST) to study differences in X-ray properties between CTTS and WTTS. Methods: XEST data are used to perform correlation and regression analysis between X-ray parameters and stellar properties. Results: We confirm the existence of a X-ray luminosity (L_X) vs. mass (M) relation, L_X∝ M1.69~$\pm$ 0.11, but this relation is a consequence of X-ray saturation and a mass vs. bolometric luminosity (L_*) relation for the TTS with an average age of 2.4 Myr. X-ray saturation indicates LX = const.L_*, although the constant is different for the two subsamples: const. = 10-3.73~$\pm$ 0.05 for CTTS and const. = 10-3.39~$\pm$ 0.06 for WTTS. Given a similar L* distribution of both samples, the X-ray luminosity function also reflects a real X-ray deficiency in CTTS, by a factor of ≈2 compared to WTTS. The average electron temperatures T_av are correlated with LX in WTTS but not in CTTS; CTTS sources are on average hotter than WTTS sources. At best marginal dependencies are found between X-ray properties and mass accretion rates or age.  Conclusions: The most fundamental properties are the two saturation laws, indicating suppressed LX for CTTS. We speculate that some of the accreting material in CTTS is cooling active regions to temperatures that may not significantly emit in the X-ray band, and if they do, high-resolution spectroscopy may be required to identify lines formed in such plasma, while CCD cameras do not detect these components. The similarity of the LX vs. T_av dependencies in WTTS and main-sequence stars as well as their similar X-ray saturation laws suggests similar physical processes for the hot plasma, i.e., heating and radiation of a magnetic corona.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We have analyzed optical spectra of 25 X-ray sources identified as potential new members of the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC), in order to confirm their membership in this star-forming region. Methods: Fifty-seven candidate members were previously selected among the X-ray sources in the XEST survey, having a 2MASS counterpart compatible with a pre-main sequence star based on color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. We obtained high-resolution optical spectra for 7 of these candidates with the SARG spectrograph at the TNG telescope, which were used to search for lithium absorption and to measure the Halpha line and the radial and rotational velocities. Then, 18 low-resolution optical spectra obtained with the instrument DOLORES for other candidate members were used for spectral classification, for Halpha measurements, and to assess membership together with IR color-color and color-magnitude diagrams and additional information from the X-ray data.  Results: We found that 3 sources show lithium absorption, with equivalent widths (EWs) of  500 m{\AA}, broad spectral line profiles, indicating rotational velocities of  20{-}40 km s-1, radial velocities consistent with those for known members, and Halpha emission. Two of them are classified as new weak-lined T Tauri stars, while the EW ( -9 {\AA}) of the Halpha line and its broad asymmetric profile clearly indicate that the third star (XEST-26-062) is a classical T Tauri star. Fourteen sources observed with DOLORES are M-type stars. Fifteen sources show Halpha emission. Six of them have spectra that indicate surface gravity lower than in main sequence stars, and their de-reddened positions in IR color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with their derived spectral type and with pre-main sequence models at the distance of the TMC. The K-type star XEST-11-078 is confirmed as a new member on the basis of the strength of the Halpha emission line. Overall, we confirm membership to the TMC for 10 out of 25 X-ray sources observed in the optical. Three sources remain uncertain.

	Abstract = {Cygnus OB2 is the nearest example of a massive star-forming region (SFR), containing over 50 O-type stars and hundreds of B-type stars. We have analyzed the properties of young stars in two fields in Cyg OB2 using the recently published deep catalog of Chandra X-ray point sources with complementary optical and near-IR photometry. Our sample is complete to ~1 M sun (excluding A- and B-type stars that do not emit X-rays), making this the deepest study of the stellar properties and star formation history in Cyg OB2 to date. From Siess et al. isochrone fits to the near-IR color-magnitude diagram, we derive ages of 3.5+0.75 -1.0 and 5.25+1.5 -1.0 Myr for sources in the two fields, both with considerable spreads around the pre-main-sequence isochrones. The presence of a stellar population somewhat older than the present-day O-type stars, also fits in with the low fraction of sources with inner circumstellar disks (as traced by the K-band excess) that we find to be very low, but appropriate for a population of age ~5 Myr. We also find that the region lacks a population of highly embedded sources that is often observed in young SFRs, suggesting star formation in the vicinity has declined. We measure the stellar mass functions (MFs) in this limit and find a power-law slope of Gamma = -1.09 $\pm$ 0.13, in good agreement with the global mean value estimated by Kroupa. A steepening of the slope at higher masses is observed and suggested as due to the presence of the previous generation of stars that have lost their most massive members. Finally, combining our MF and an estimate of the radial density profile of the association suggests a total mass of Cyg OB2 of ~3 × 104 M sun, similar to that of many of our Galaxy's most massive SFRs.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 1696 X-ray sources detected in the massive star-forming region (SFR) Cygnus OB2 and extracted from two archival Chandra observations of the center of the region. A deep source extraction routine, exploiting the low background rates of Chandra observations, was employed to maximize the number of sources extracted. Observations at other wavelengths were used to identify low count-rate sources and remove likely spurious sources. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to assess the authenticity of these sources. X-ray spectra were fitted with thermal plasma models to characterize the objects and X-ray light curves were analyzed to determine their variability. We used a Bayesian technique to identify optical or near-IR counterparts for 1501 (89%) of our sources, using deep observations from the INT Photometric Halpha survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Galactic Plane Survey. Seven hundred and fifty seven (45%) of these objects have six-band r', Halpha, i', J, H, and Ks optical and near-IR photometry. From an analysis of the Poisson false-source probabilities for each source we estimate that our X-ray catalog includes <1% of false sources, and an even lower fraction when only sources with optical or near-IR associations are considered. A Monte Carlo simulation of the Bayesian matching scheme allows this method to be compared to more simplified matching techniques and enables the various sources of error to be quantified. The catalog of 1696 objects presented here includes X-ray broadband fluxes, model fits, and optical and near-IR photometry in what is one of the largest X-ray catalog of a single SFR to date. The high number of stellar X-ray sources detected from relatively shallow observations confirms the status and importance of Cygnus OB2 as one of our Galaxy's most massive SFRs.},

	Abstract = {At fast rotation rates, the coronal activity of G- and K-type stars has been observed to 'saturate' and then decline again at even faster rotation rates - a phenomenon dubbed 'supersaturation'. In this paper, we investigate coronal activity in fast-rotating M-dwarfs using deep XMM-Newton observations of 97 low-mass stars of known rotation period in the young open cluster NGC 2547 and combine these with published X-ray surveys of low-mass field and cluster stars of known rotation period. Like G- and K-dwarfs, we find that M-dwarfs exhibit increasing coronal activity with decreasing Rossby number NR, the ratio of period to convective turnover time, and that activity saturates at LX/Lbol~= 10-3 for log NR < -0.8. However, supersaturation is not convincingly displayed by M-dwarfs, despite the presence of many objects in our sample with log NR < -1.8, where supersaturation is observed to occur in higher mass stars. Instead, it appears that a short rotation period is the primary predictor of supersaturation; P <= 0.3 d for K-dwarfs and perhaps P <= 0.2 d for M-dwarfs. These observations favour the 'centrifugal stripping' model for supersaturation, where coronal structures are forced open or become radiatively unstable as the Keplerian corotation radius moves inside the X-ray-emitting coronal volume.},

	Abstract = {Circumstellar disks are thought to experience a rapid "transition" phase in their evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation and early development of planetary systems. We present new and archival high angular resolution (0.3" = 40-75 AU) Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the 880 micron dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearby star-forming regions. In each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central star. Using radiative transfer calculations, we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric model framework by reproducing their SMA visibilities and SEDs. The cavities in these disks are large (R_cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small (~um-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. The structures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal disks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are common among the millimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 20% of the disks in the bright half of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution. Utilizing these results, we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to account for transition disk structures. As has been shown before, photoevaporation models do not produce the large cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk masses representative of this sample. It would be difficult to achieve a sufficient decrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth alone: substantial growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of AU) regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small particles. Given those challenges, we suggest instead that the observations are most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions with low-mass companions --young brown dwarfs or giant planets on long-period orbits.},

	Abstract = {We present XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations of the classical T Tauri star AA Tau covering almost two rotational periods where P_rot ˜ 8.5 days. Clear, but uncorrelated variability is found at both wavebands. The variability observed at ~2100 {\AA} follows the previously known optical period. Spectral analysis of the X-ray data results in significant variability in the X-ray absorption such that the times of maximal X-ray absorption and UV extinction coincide. Placing the coronal emission in regions at low up to moderate magnetic latitudes and attribution of the variable X-ray absorption to accretion curtains and/or the disk warp provides a consistent physical picture. However, the derived X-ray absorption and optical extinction at times of maximal optical/UV brightness, i.e. outside occultation, are difficult to reconcile, requiring additional absorption in a disk wind or a peculiar dust grain distribution.},

	Abstract = {We explore loose congregations of medium- to high-mass protoclusters identified to the southeast of NGC 2244. On using data from the spatially complete Two Micron All Sky Survey, the true extent of the burst of cluster formation along the ridge of the Rosette Molecular Cloud is revealed. Here we investigate the properties and fine structures of the most prominent cluster embedded in the densest rim of the cloud. This protocluster is resolved into two compact subclusters aligned along the major axis of the entire complex, in line with NGC 2244. The subclusters are found to have a physical scale of around 1 pc, typical of known embedded clusters. The K-band luminosity function also suggests a young age. However, near-infrared excess emission is found in approximately one-sixth of the reddened objects. This is still commensurate with an age estimate of <1 Myr, provided that the massive stars have rapidly stripped the circumstellar material from their neighbors. The well-known massive young binary associated with AFGL 961, however, is situated to the south of the major components of the cluster, where the stellar density is comparatively low. This is inconsistent with mass segregation and signifies a different formation process for these high-mass protostellar objects.},

	Abstract = {The Rosette Molecular Complex contains embedded clusters with diverse properties and origins. We have previously explored the shell mode of formation in the north (regions A and B) and the massive concentrations in the ridge (region C). Here we explore star formation toward the south of the complex, region D, based on data from the spatially complete Two Micron All Sky Survey. We find that stars are forming prolifically throughout this region in a highly structured mode, with both clusters and loose aggregates detected. The most prominent cluster (region D1) lies in the north-center. This cluster is over 20 pc to the south of the Monoceros Ridge, the interface of the emerging young OB cluster NGC 2244 with its ambient molecular clouds. In addition, there are several branches stemming from AFGL 961 in region C and extending to the southeastern boundary of the cloud. We invoke a tree model to interpret this pattern, corresponding to probable tracks of abrupt turbulent excitation and subsequent decay. Alternatively, we discuss gravoturbulent collapse scenarios based on numerical simulations. Relative stellar ages and gas flow directions will differentiate between these mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The incidence of dusty debris disks around low- and intermediate-mass stars has been investigated numerous times in order to understand the early stages of planet formation. Most notably, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) mission observed the entire sky at mid- and far-infrared (IR) wavelengths, identifying the first debris disk systems, but was unable to detect a statistically significant sample of warm debris disks due to its limited sensitivity at 12 mum. Using Tycho-2 Spectral Catalog stars previously shown to exhibit 8 mum mid-IR circumstellar excesses confirmed at 24 mum in the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared MidPlane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) survey, we investigate the frequency of mid-IR excesses among intermediate-mass (2-4 M sun) stars in a complete volume-limited sample. Our study of 338 stars is four times larger than a complete sample of 12 mum sources from the IRAS Point Source Catalog. We find that 0.3% $\pm$ 0.3% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit a signature of a possible terrestrial-temperature debris disks at wavelengths of 8 mum and greater. We also find that 1.2% $\pm$ 0.6% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit evidence for circumstellar disks undergoing inner disk clearing, i.e., candidate transition disk systems. Using stellar lifetimes and the frequency of transition and primordial disks within a given spectral type, we find that pre-main-sequence disks around intermediate-mass stars dissipate in 5 $\pm$ 2 Myr, consistent with other studies.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a deep near-infrared imaging survey of the Rosette complex made with FLAMINGOS at the 2.1 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. We studied the distribution of young embedded sources using a variation of the nearest neighbor method applied to a carefully selected sample of near-infrared excess (NIRX) stars that trace the latest episode of star formation in the complex. Our analysis confirmed the existence of seven clusters previously detected in the molecular cloud, and identified four more clusters across the complex. We determined that 60% of the young stars in the complex and 86% of the stars within the molecular cloud are contained in clusters, implying that the majority of stars in the Rosette formed in embedded clusters. Also, half of the young embedded population is contained in four clusters that coincide with the central core of the cloud, where the main interaction with the H II region is taking place. We compare the sizes, infrared excess fractions, and average extinction toward individual clusters to investigate their early evolution and expansion. In particular, the size and degree of central condensation within the clusters appear to be related to the degree of infrared excess and mean extinction in a way that suggests that the clusters form as compact entities and then quickly expand after formation. We found that the average infrared excess fraction of clusters increases as a function of distance from NGC 2244, implying a temporal sequence of star formation across the complex. This sequence appears to be primordial, possibly resulting from the formation and evolution of the molecular cloud and not from the interaction with the H II region. Instead, the main influence of the H II region could be to enhance or inhibit the underlying pattern of star formation in the cloud.},

	Abstract = {The very young open cluster (OC) NGC2244 in the Rosette Nebula was studied with field-star-decontaminated Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry, which shows the main-sequence (MS) stars and an abundant pre-MS (PMS) population. Fundamental and structural parameters were derived with colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), stellar radial density profiles (RDPs) and mass functions (MFs). Most previous studies centred NGC2244 close to the bright K0V star 12Monocerotis, which is not a cluster member. Instead, the near-infrared RDP indicates a pronounced core near the O5 star HD46150. We derive an age within 1-6Myr, an absorption AV = 1.7 +/- 0.2, a distance from the Sun dsolar = 1.6 +/- 0.2kpc (~1.5kpc outside the solar circle), an MF slope chi = 0.91 +/- 0.13 and a total (MS+PMS) stellar mass of ~625Msolar. Its RDP is characterized by the core and cluster radii Rc ~ 5.6arcmin (~2.6pc) and RRDP ~ 10arcmin (~4.7pc), respectively. Departure from dynamical equilibrium is suggested by the abnormally large core radius and the marked central stellar excess. We also investigate the elusive neighbouring OC NGC2239, which is low mass (mMS+PMS ~ 301Msolar), young (5 +/- 4Myr) rather absorbed (AV = 3.4 +/- 0.2), and located in the background of NGC2244 at dsolar = 3.9 +/- 0.4kpc. Its RDP follows a King-like function of Rc ~ 0.5arcmin ~ 0.5pc and RRDP ~ 5.0arcmin ~ 5.6pc. The MF slope, chi = 1.24 +/- 0.06, is essentially Salpeter's initial mass function. NGC2244 is probably doomed to dissolution in a few 107yr. Wide-field extractions and field-star decontamination increase the stellar statistics and enhance both CMDs and RDPs, which is essential for faint and bright star clusters.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We have previously analysed the spectra of 135 early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and found several groups of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict with the theory of rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) metallicities.  Methods: We provide chemical compositions for ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type stars and compare these to the LMC results. These samples cover a range of projected rotational velocities up to ~300 km s-1 and hence are well suited to testing rotational mixing models. The surface nitrogen abundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process since nitrogen is synthesized in the core of the stars and mixed to the surface.  Results: In the SMC, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars amongst the early B type core-hydrogen burning stars, which is comparable to that found previously in the LMC. The identification of non-enriched rapid rotators in the SMC is not possible due to the relatively high upper limits on the nitrogen abundance for the fast rotators. In the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the core hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectation from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. However, only a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce a significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enriched rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally, in each metallicity regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannot be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. Their abundances are, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous red supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex picture of the nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellar atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether rotational mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at this time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in those groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models.

	Abstract = {The Herschel OB young stellar objects survey (HOBYS) has observed the Rosette molecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formation activity. These new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact young stellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. We compiled a sample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers the near-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. These were used to constrain key properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, and envelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. Several clusters are distinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinity of luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. The analysed protostellar population in Rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 M_o with luminosities between 1 and 150 L_o, which extends the evolutionary diagram from low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. Some sources lack counterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth. The central cluster and the Phelps & Lada 7 cluster appear less evolved than the remainder of the analysed protostellar population. For the central cluster, we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as Class I from near- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate Class 0 objects. As a showcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- to intermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent different evolutionary stages from Class 0 to Class I. Their mid- to far-infrared spectral slopes flatten towards the Class I stage, and the 160 to 70 mum flux ratio is greatest for the presumed Class 0 source. This shows that the Herschel observations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution in detail.

	Abstract = {We present the initial highlights of the HOBYS key program, which are based on Herschel images of the Rosette molecular complex and maps of the RCW120 H ii region. Using both SPIRE at 250/350/500 mum and PACS at 70/160 mum or 100/160 mum, the HOBYS survey provides an unbiased and complete census of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects, some of which are not detected by Spitzer. Key core properties, such as bolometric luminosity and mass (as derived from spectral energy distributions), are used to constrain their evolutionary stages. We identify a handful of high-mass prestellar cores and show that their lifetimes could be shorter in the Rosette molecular complex than in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. We also quantify the impact of expanding H ii regions on the star formation process acting in both Rosette and RCW 120.

	Abstract = {We explore here the young stellar populations in the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) region with high spatial resolution X-ray images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which are effective in locating weak-lined T Tauri stars as well as disk-bearing young stars. A total of 395 X-ray point sources are detected, 299 of which (76%) have an optical or near-infrared (NIR) counterpart identified from deep FLAMINGOS images. From X-ray and mass sensitivity limits, we infer a total population of ~1700 young stars in the survey region. Based on smoothed stellar surface density maps, we investigate the spatial distribution of the X-ray sources and define three distinctive structures and substructures within them. Structures B and C are associated with previously known embedded IR clusters, while structure A is a new X-ray-identified unobscured cluster. A high-mass protostar RMCX #89 = IRAS 06306+0437 and its associated sparse cluster are studied. The different subregions are not coeval but do not show a simple spatial-age pattern. Disk fractions vary between subregions and are generally lsim20% of the total stellar population inferred from the X-ray survey. The data are consistent with speculations that triggered star formation around the H II region is present in the RMC, but do not support a simple sequential triggering process through the cloud interior. While a significant fraction of young stars are located in a distributed population throughout the RMC region, it is not clear if they originated in clustered environments.},

	Abstract = {We present the first high spatial resolution X-ray study of NGC 2244, the 2 Myr old stellar cluster in the Rosette Nebula, using Chandra. Over 900 X-ray sources are detected; 77% have optical or FLAMINGOS NIR stellar counterparts and are mostly previously uncataloged young cluster members. The X-ray-selected population is estimated to be nearly complete between 0.5 and 3 Msolar. A number of further results emerge from our analysis: (1) The X-ray LF and the associated K-band LF indicate a normal Salpeter IMF for NGC 2244. This is inconsistent with the top-heavy IMF reported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of <4 Msolar stars. By comparing the NGC 2244 and Orion Nebula Cluster XLFs, we estimate a total population of ~2000 stars in NGC 2244. (2) The spatial distribution of X-ray stars is strongly concentrated around the central O5 star, HD 46150. The other early O star, HD 46223, has few companions. The cluster's stellar radial density profile shows two distinctive structures: a power-law cusp around HD 46150 that extends to ~0.7 pc, surrounded by an isothermal sphere extending out to 4 pc with core radius 1.2 pc. This double structure, combined with the absence of mass segregation, indicates that this 2 Myr old cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium. (3) The fraction of X-ray-selected cluster members with K-band excesses caused by inner protoplanetary disks is 6%, slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimated from the FLAMINGOS study based on the NIR-selected sample. (4) X-ray luminosities for 24 stars earlier than B4 confirm the long-standing log(LX/Lbol)~-7 relation. The Rosette OB X-ray spectra are soft and consistent with the standard model of small-scale shocks in the inner wind of a single massive star.},

	Abstract = {We present high spatial resolution Chandra X-ray images of the NGC 2237 young stellar cluster on the periphery of the Rosette Nebula. We detect 168 X-ray sources, 80% of which have stellar counterparts in USNO, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and deep FLAMINGOS images. These constitute the first census of the cluster members with 0.2 <~ M <~ 2 M sun. Star locations in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams indicate a cluster age around 2 Myr with a visual extinction of 1 <~ AV <~ 3 at 1.4 kpc, the distance of the Rosette Nebula's main cluster NGC 2244. We derive the K-band luminosity function and the X-ray luminosity function of the cluster, which indicate a population ~400-600 stars. The X-ray-selected sample shows a K-excess disk frequency of 13%. The young Class II counterparts are aligned in an arc ~3 pc long suggestive of a triggered formation process induced by the O stars in NGC 2244. The diskless Class III sources are more dispersed. Several X-ray emitting stars are located inside the molecular cloud and around gaseous pillars projecting from the cloud. These stars, together with a previously unreported optical outflow originating inside the cloud, indicate that star formation is continuing at a low level and the cluster is still growing. This X-ray view of young stars on the western side of the Rosette Nebula complements our earlier studies of the central cluster NGC 2244 and the embedded clusters on the eastern side of the Nebula. The large-scale distribution of the clusters and molecular material is consistent with a scenario in which the rich central NGC 2244 cluster formed first, and its expanding H II region triggered the formation of the now-unobscured satellite clusters Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) XA and NGC 2237. A large swept-up shell material around the H II region is now in a second phase of collect-and-collapse fragmentation, leading to the recent formation of subclusters. Other clusters deeper in the molecular cloud appear unaffected by the Rosette Nebula expansion.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Chemical abundances in solar-type stars are still a much debated topic in many respects. In particular, planet-hosting stars are known to be metal-rich, but whether or not this peculiarity applies also to the chemical composition of the outer stellar atmospheres is still to be clarified. More in general, coronal and photospheric abundances in late-type stars appear to be different in many cases, but understanding how chemical stratification effects work in stellar atmospheres requires an observational base larger than currently available.  Methods: We obtained XMM-Newton high-resolution X-ray spectra of tau Bootis, a well known nearby star with a Jovian-mass close-in planet. We analyzed these data with the aim to perform a detailed line-based emission measure analysis and derive the abundances of individual elements in the corona with two different methods applied independently. We compared the coronal abundances of tau Bootis with published photospheric abundances based on high-resolution optical spectra and with those of other late-type stars with different magnetic activity levels, including the Sun.  Results: We find that the two methods provide consistent results within the statistical uncertainties for both the emission measure distribution of the hot plasma and for the coronal abundances, with discrepancies at the 2sigma level limited to the amount of plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK and to the O and Ni abundances. In both cases, the elements for which both coronal and photospheric measurements are available (C, N, O, Si, Fe, and Ni) result systematically less abundant in the corona by a factor 3 or more, with the exception of the coronal Ni abundance which is similar to the photospheric value. Comparison with other late-type stars of similar activity level shows that these coronal/photospheric abundance ratios are peculiar to tau Bootis and possibly related to the characteristic over-metallicity of this planet-hosting star.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 50, 000) infrared K-band echelle spectra of 14 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We model Zeeman broadening in three magnetically sensitive Ti I lines near 2.2 mum and consistently detect kilogauss-level magnetic fields in the stellar photospheres. The data are consistent in each case with the entire stellar surface being covered with magnetic fields, suggesting that magnetic pressure likely dominates over gas pressure in the photospheres of these stars. These very strong magnetic fields might themselves be responsible for the underproduction of X-ray emission of TTSs relative to what is expected based on main-sequence star calibrations. We combine these results with previous measurements of 14 stars in Taurus and 5 stars in the TW Hydrae association to study the potential variation of magnetic field properties during the first 10 million years of stellar evolution, finding a steady decline in total magnetic flux with age.

	Abstract = {We present Doppler images of the weak-lined T Tauri star V410 Tau obtained with two different Doppler-imaging codes. The images are consistent and show a cool extended spot, symmetric about the pole, at a temperature approximately 750 K below the average photospheric value. Smaller cool spots are found fairly uniformly distributed at latitudes below the polar cap with temperatures about 450 K below the average photospheric temperature. Resolution on the stellar surface is limited to about 7$\,^{\circ}$ of arc, so structure within these spots is not visible. Also at lower latitudes are hotter features with temperatures up to 1000 K above the photosphere. A trial Doppler image using a TiO molecular feature reproduced the cool polar cap at a temperature about 100 K below the value from the atomic line images. The equatorial features, however, were not properly reproduced since Doppler imaging relies on information in the wings of lines for reconstructing equatorial features, and for V410 Tau these molecular band lines overlap. In 1993, V410 Tau had a large photometric amplitude resulting from the concentration of cool spots on the hemisphere of the star visible at phase 0$\,^{\circ}$, a phenomenon known as preferred longitude. In contrast, the small photometric amplitude observed currently is due to a strong symmetric polar spot and the uniform distribution in longitude of equatorial cool and warm spots. This redistribution of surface features may be the beginning of a slow "flip-flop" for V410 Tau where spot locations alternate between preferred longitudes. Flare events linked to two of the hotter spots in the Doppler image were observed.},

	Abstract = {Context. T Tauri stars have X-ray luminosities in the range LX = 1028-1032 erg s-1. These luminosities are similar to their UV luminosities (LUV ~ 1030-1031 erg s-1) and therefore X-rays are expected to affect the physics and chemistry of the upper layers of their surrounding protoplanetary disks.  Aims: The effects and importance of X-rays on the chemical and hydrostatic structure of protoplanetary disks are investigated, species tracing X-ray irradiation (for LX >= 1029 erg s-1) are identified and predictions for [O i], [C ii], and [N ii] fine structure line fluxes are provided.  Methods: We implemented X-ray physics and chemistry into the chemo-physical disk code ProDiMo. We include Coulomb heating and H2 ionization as heating processes and both primary and secondary ionization due to X-rays in the chemistry.  Results: X-rays heat the gas causing it to expand in the optically thin surface layers. Neutral molecular species are not significantly affected in terms of their abundance and spatial distribution, but charged species such as N+, OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ display enhanced abundances in the disk surface.  Conclusions: Coulomb heating by X-rays changes the vertical structure of the disk, yielding temperatures of ~8000 K out to distances of 50 AU. The chemical structure is altered by the high electron abundance of the gas at the disk surface, causing an efficient ion-molecule chemistry. The products of this, OH+, H2O+ and H3O+, are of great interest for observations of low-mass young stellar objects with the Herschel Space Observatory. Both [O i] (at 63 and 145 mum) and [C ii] (at 158 mum) fine structure emission are affected only for LX > 1030 erg s-1.},

	Abstract = {We present a volume-limited multiplicity survey with magnitude cutoff ({m}K<= 10.5 mag) of 158 young stellar objects located within or in the vicinity of the rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud. With exception of eleven already well observed objects, all sources have been observed by us in the K-band with 3.5 m telescopes by using speckle techniques. The separation range covered by our survey is 0.13''<=theta<= 6.4'', where the lower limit is given by the diffraction limit of the telescopes and the upper limit by confusion with background stars. The multiplicity survey is complete for flux ratios >= 0.1 (Delta{m}K<= 2.5) at the diffraction limit. After taking the background density into account the degree of multiplicity is 29.1%$\pm$ 4.3% and thus only marginally higher than the value 23.5%$\pm$ 4.8 % derived for the given separation range for the main-sequence solar-like stars in the solar neighbourhood (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). We discuss the implications of these findings.},

	Abstract = {The Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex has produced in Lynds 1688 the richest known embedded cluster within ˜300 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, distance estimates to the Oph complex vary by nearly ˜40% (˜120-165 pc). Here I calculate a new independent distance estimate of 135 $\pm$ 8 pc to this benchmark star-forming region based on Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes to stars illuminating reflection nebulosity in close proximity to Lynds 1688. Combining this value with recent distance estimates from reddening studies suggests a consensus distance of 139 $\pm$ 6 pc (4% error), situating it within ˜11 pc of the centroid of the ˜5 Myr old Upper Sco OB subgroup of Sco OB2 (145 pc). The velocity vectors for Oph and Upper Sco are statistically indistinguishable within ˜1 km s-1 in each vector component. Both Oph and Upper Sco have negligible motion (<1 km s-1) in the Galactic vertical direction with respect to the Local Standard of Rest, which is inconsistent with the young stellar groups having formed via the high velocity cloud impact scenario.},

	Abstract = {Variations in molecular cloud environments have the potential to affect the composition and structure of the circumstellar disks therein. To this end, comparative analyses of nearby star-forming regions are essential to informing theoretical work. In particular, the Ophiuchus molecular clouds are ideal for comparison as they are more compact with much higher extinction than Taurus, the low-mass exemplar, and experience a moderate amount of external radiation. We have carried out a study of a collection of 136 young stellar objects in the <1 Myr old Ophiuchus star-forming region, featuring Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra from 5 to 36 mum, supplemented with photometry from 0.3 mum to 1.3 mm. By classifying these objects using the McClure new molecular cloud extinction law to establish an extinction-independent index, we arrive at a ~10% embedded objects fraction, producing an embedded lifetime of 0.2 Myr, similar to that in Taurus. We analyze the degree of dust sedimentation and dust grain processing in the disks, finding that the disks are highly settled with signs of significant dust processing even at ~0.3 Myr. Finally, we discuss the wealth of evidence for radial gap structures which could be evidence for disk-planet interactions and explore the effects of stellar multiplicity on the degree of settling and radial structure.},

	Abstract = {One of the central goals of the Spitzer Legacy Project ``From Cores to Disks'' (c2d) is to determine the frequency of circumstellar disks around weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) and to study the properties and evolutionary status of these disks. Here we present a census of disks for a sample of over 230 WTTSs located in the c2d IRAC and MIPS maps of the Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Perseus Molecular Clouds. We find that ~20% of the WTTSs in a magnitude-limited subsample have IR excesses at IRAC wavelengths. These disks frequencies are ~3-6 times larger than that recently found for a sample of relatively isolated WTTSs located outside the highest extinction regions covered by the c2d maps. The disk fractions we find are more consistent with those obtained in recent Spitzer studies of WTTSs in young clusters such as IC 348 and Tr 37. According to their location in the H-R diagram, the WTTSs with excesses in our sample are among the younger part of the age distribution. Still, up to ~50% of the apparently youngest stars in the sample show no evidence of IR excess, suggesting that the circumstellar disks of a sizable fraction of pre-main-sequence stars dissipate in a timescale of ~1 Myr. We also find that none of the stars in our sample apparently older than ~10 Myr have detectable circumstellar disks at wavelengths <24 mum. The WTTS disks in our sample exhibit a wide range of properties (SED morphology, inner radius, Ldisk/L*, etc.) that bridge the gaps observed between the CTTSs and the debris disk regimes.},

	Abstract = {Cool stars are known to produce flares probably as a result of the magnetic reconnection in their outer atmospheres. We present simultaneous XMM-Newton optical V band and X-ray observations of the M8 dwarf LP 412-31. During the observation a giant flare occurred, with an optical amplitude of 6 mag and total energy of 3 × 1032 erg in both the V band and soft X-rays. Both flare onset and flare decay were completely covered in both wavebands with a temporal resolution of 20 s, allowing determination of the flare time scales, as well as a study of the temperature evolution of the flaring plasma. The data are consistent with an impulsive energy release followed by radiative cooling without any further energy release during the decay phase. Our analysis suggests that the optical flare originates from a small fraction of the surface of LP 412-31, while the characteristic scale size of the flaring X-ray plasma is of the order of the stellar radius or larger. The absence of any small-scale variability in the light curve suggests a non-standard flare number energy distribution.},

@article{tur10,
	Abstract = {We apply ionization balance and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) calculations to investigate whether magnetic activity moderated by recombination on dust grains can account for the mass accretion rates and the mid-infrared spectra and variability of protostellar disks. The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the resistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among solar-mass T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variations in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity, but can plausibly be produced by varying these parameters together with the disk magnetic flux. The diverse shapes and strengths of the mid-infrared silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magnetorotational turbulence, through the following three effects. First, recombination on grains 1 mum or smaller yields a magnetically inactive dead zone extending more than two scale heights from the midplane, while turbulent motions in the magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoot the dead zone boundary by only about one scale height. Second, grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically in wave motions driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the rates found in laminar flow, so that the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk atmosphere will become dust-depleted unless resupplied from elsewhere. Third, with sufficient depletion, the dead zone is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The last of these processes enables evolutionary signatures such as the degree of settling to sometimes decrease with age. The MHD results also show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of small grains into the atmosphere. Consequently the photosphere height changes by up to one-third over timescales of a few orbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface varies by factors of 2 over times down to a tenth of an orbit. We suggest that the changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the daily to monthly mid-infrared variability found in many young stars.},

	Abstract = {The Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, is heated to millions of degrees, considerably hotter than its surface or photosphere. Explanations for this enigma typically invoke the deposition in the corona of nonthermal energy generated by magnetoconvection. However, the coronal heating mechanism remains unknown. We used observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Hinode solar physics mission to reveal a ubiquitous coronal mass supply in which chromospheric plasma in fountainlike jets or spicules is accelerated upward into the corona, with much of the plasma heated to temperatures between ~0.02 and 0.1 million kelvin (MK) and a small but sufficient fraction to temperatures above 1 MK. These observations provide constraints on the coronal heating mechanism(s) and highlight the importance of the interface region between photosphere and corona.},

	Abstract = {We present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new FU Orionis-like young stellar object Lk Halpha 188-G4 (also known as HBC 722 and PTF 10qpf). Prior to this outburst, Lk Halpha 188-G4 would have been classified as a classical T Tauri star on the basis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a K8-type photosphere, and photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index of Lk Halpha 188-G4 indicates a Class II type object. Lk Halpha 188-G4 exhibited a steady rise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in Aug. 2009, before a subsequent more abrupt rise of >3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. Observations taken during and after eruption exhibit all of the defining characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (i) Lk Halpha 188-G4 increased in brightness by >4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infrared reflection nebula has now appeared (iii) optical spectra in the outburst phase are consistent with a G supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being Halpha which is characterized by a P Cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectra in the outburst phase resemble late K--M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in the molecular bands of CO and H_2O, and (v) outflow signatures in H, He, and low excitation metallic lines are seen in the form of blue-shifted absorption profiles. Lk Halpha 188-G4 is the first member of the FU Orionis class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. The association of the PTF 10qpf outburst with this previously identified classical T Tauri star provides strong evidence that FU Orionis eruptions represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered by instabilities in the disk.},

	Abstract = {We present high-precision photometry on 107 variable low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the ~3 Myr sigma Orionis open cluster. We have carried out I-band photometric monitoring within two fields, encompassing 153 confirmed or candidate members of the low-mass cluster population, from 0.02 to 0.5 M sun. We are sensitive to brightness changes on timescales from 10 minutes to two weeks with amplitudes as low as 0.004 mag, and find variability on these timescales in nearly 70% of cluster members. We identify both periodic and aperiodic modes of variability, as well as semi-periodic rapid fading events that are not accounted for by the standard explanations of rotational modulation of surface features or accretion. We have incorporated both optical and infrared color data to uncover trends in variability with mass and circumstellar disks. While the data confirm that the lowest-mass objects (M < 0.2 M sun) rotate more rapidly than the 0.2-0.5 M sun members, they do not support a direct connection between rotation rate and the presence of a disk. Finally, we speculate on the origin of irregular variability in cluster members with no evidence for disks or accretion.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a new method for the reconstruction of differential emission measure distributions based on a Metropolis Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC[M]) method. This technique allows us to (1) relax nonphysical smoothness constraints generally imposed on DEMs, (2) determine confidence bounds on the computed values, and (3) include extra information in the form of upper limits. Using the MCMC[M] algorithm, we reanalyze extreme ultraviolet spectral line fluxes obtained from Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph observations by Brosius et al. to obtain differential emission measure (DEM) distributions for active and quiet regions on the Sun. Both active- and quiet-region DEMs show a probable minimum near log T ~ 5.6; the quiet-region DEM drops off beyond log T = 6.4, while the active-region DEM does not show evidence of a significant downturn even at log T = 7. The most striking aspect of our results is that the latter also shows several sharp peaks (of width ~0.1 dex), notably at log T = 6 and 6.3, and a broad feature, beyond log T = 6.5. We also explore the limitations on DEM reconstruction imposed by imperfect atomic data, choice of spectral lines, uncertainties in abundances, and other systematic errors. Within these limitations, we discuss the derived emission measure distribution and comment on its implications to coronal structure. We conclude that calculation of uncertainties on the DEM are crucial in the interpretation of structure seen in reconstructions. Further, a careful selection of the spectral lines used to infer the DEM is needed in order to avoid "artificially" generating structure in the DEM.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the star formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) using the age and mass derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and from color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We also examined the physical and structural parameters of more than 1000 pre-main-sequence stars in NGC 2264 using the online SED fitting tool (SED fitter) of Robitaille et al. We have compared the physical parameters of central stars from SED fitter and other methods. The temperature of the central star is, in many cases, much higher than that expected from its spectral type. The mass and age from SED fitter are not well matched with those from CMDs. We have made some suggestions to improve the accuracy of temperature estimates in the SED fitter. In most cases, these parameters of individual stars from the SED fitter in a star-forming region (SFR) or in the whole cluster showed nearly no systematic variation with age or with any other relevant parameter. On the other hand, the median properties of stars in NGC 2264 SFRs showed an evident evolutionary effect and were interrelated to each other. Such differences are caused by a larger age spread within an SFR than between them. The cumulative distribution of stellar ages showed a distinct difference among SFRs. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gave a very low probability of them being from the same population. The results indicate that star formation in NGC 2264 started at the surface region (Halo and Field regions) about 6-7 Myr ago, propagated into the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the Spokes cluster. The kind of sequential star formation that started in the low-density surface region (Halo and Field regions) implies that star formation in NGC 2264 was triggered by an external source. The IMF of NGC 2264 was determined in two different ways. One method used the stellar mass from the SED fitting tool, the other used the stellar mass from CMDs. The first IMF showed a distinct peak at m ≈ 2 M sun, but the second did not. We attribute the peak as an artifact of the SED fitting tool because there is no such IMF with a peak at m ≈ 2 M sun. The slope of the IMF of NGC 2264 for massive stars (log m >= 0.5) is --1.7 $\pm$ 0.1, which is somewhat steeper than the so-called standard Salpeter-Kroupa IMF. We also present data for 79 young brown dwarf candidates.},

	Abstract = {We combine the results from several multiplicity surveys of pre-main-sequence stars located in four nearby star-forming regions with Spitzer data from three different Legacy Projects. This allows us to construct a sample of 349 targets, including 125 binaries, which we use to to investigate the effect of companions on the evolution of circumstellar disks. We find that the distribution of projected separations of systems with Spitzer excesses is significantly different (P~ 2.4e-5, according to the K-S test for binaries with separations less than 400 AU) from that of systems lacking evidence for a disk. As expected, systems with projected separations less than 40 AU are half as likely to retain at least one disk than are systems with projected separations in the 40-400 AU range. These results represent the first statistically significant evidence for a correlation between binary separation and the presence of an inner disk (r~ 1 AU). Several factors (e.g., the incompleteness of the census of close binaries, the use of unresolved disk indicators, and projection effects) have previously masked this correlation in smaller samples. We discuss the implications of our findings for circumstellar disk lifetimes and the formation of planets in multiple systems.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained millimeter-wavelength photometry, high-resolution optical spectroscopy, and adaptive optics near-infrared imaging for a sample of 26 Spitzer-selected transition circumstellar disks. All of our targets are located in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud (d ~ 125 pc) and have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggesting the presence of inner opacity holes. We use these ground-based data to estimate the disk mass, multiplicity, and accretion rate for each object in our sample in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner holes. We find that transition disks are a heterogeneous group of objects, with disk masses ranging from <0.6 to 40 M JUP and accretion rates ranging from <10-11 to 10-7 M sun yr-1, but most tend to have much lower masses and accretion rates than "full disks" (i.e., disks without opacity holes). Eight of our targets have stellar companions: six of them are binaries and the other two are triple systems. In four cases, the stellar companions are close enough to suspect they are responsible for the inferred inner holes. We find that nine of our 26 targets have low disk mass (<2.5 M JUP) and negligible accretion (<10-11 M sun yr-1), and are thus consistent with photoevaporating (or photoevaporated) disks. Four of these nine non-accreting objects have fractional disk luminosities <10-3 and could already be in a debris disk stage. Seventeen of our transition disks are accreting. Thirteen of these accreting objects are consistent with grain growth. The remaining four accreting objects have SEDs suggesting the presence of sharp inner holes, and thus are excellent candidates for harboring giant planets.

Roughly one-third of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk-to-star mass ratio is 0.5%. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is best described as Fnu~nu2.0+/-0.5 between 350 mum and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the opacity compared to the interstellar medium. The latter effect could be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer disks is removed nearly simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {We present new multiwavelength submillimeter continuum measurements of the circumstellar dust around 48 young stars in the rho Ophiuchi dark clouds. Supplemented with previous 1.3 mm observations of an additional 99 objects from the literature, the statistical distributions of disk masses and submillimeter colors are calculated and compared to those in the Taurus-Auriga region. These basic submillimeter properties of young stellar objects in both environments are shown to be essentially identical. As with their Taurus counterparts, the rho Oph circumstellar dust properties are shown to evolve along an empirical evolution sequence based on the infrared spectral energy distribution. The combined rho Oph and Taurus Class II samples (173 sources) are used to set benchmark values for basic outer disk characteristics: Md~0.005 Msolar, Md/M*~1%, and alpha~2 (where Fnu~nualpha between 350 mum and 1.3 mm). The precision of these numbers is addressed in the context of substantial solid particle growth in the earliest stages of the planet formation process. There is some circumstantial evidence that disk masses inferred from submillimeter emission may be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {NGC 2516 has been observed by Chandra several times in order to correct the plate scale of the spacecraft's focal plane instruments. Because of this, Chandra has observed NGC 2516 with all four imaging arrangements available. In addition, NGC 2516 has been observed as part of the High Resolution Camera (HRC) guaranteed time program and is scheduled for return plate scale calibration visits. This makes it the best cluster to study for long-term variability. NGC 2516 is about 140 Myr old and less than 400 pc away. In our first paper, we discussed the detection of 150 X-ray sources (42% of which are identified as cluster members) in the calibration data taken during the orbital activation phase of the Chandra mission. In our second paper, we combined all the extant data sets and detected 284 sources, more than half of which are considered likely cluster members. In this our third paper, we further explore techniques of combining Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and HRC Chandra data for timing analysis. We have been able to combine almost 70 ks of observation time, spread over five epochs, to study variability in this cluster on multiple timescales. We find that while stochastic variability rates are about the same for all objects in the sample, the timescale for detecting variability is shorter for late-type stars. Both stochastic and flare variability rates seen in NGC 2516 are similar to those seen in younger clusters IC 348, NGC 1333, and M42.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the spatial distribution of X-ray-emitting plasma in a sample of young Orion Nebula Cluster stars by modulation of their X-ray light curves due to stellar rotation. The study, part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 days of ACIS integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616 detected sources in the 17'×17' field of view. We here focus on a subsample of 233 X-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. We search for X-ray modulation using the Lomb Normalized Periodogram method. X-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23 stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from 20% to 70%. In 16 cases, the X-ray modulation period is similar to the stellar rotation period, while in 7 cases it is about half that value, possibly due to the presence of X-ray-emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes. These results constitute the largest sample of low-mass stars in which X-ray rotational modulation has been observed. The detection of rotational modulation indicates that the X-ray-emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously in longitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellar radius. Modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels (LX/Lbol~10-3) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of the stellar surface with X-ray-emitting regions.

	Abstract = {Context: The infrared [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine structure lines at 12.81 mum and 15.55 mum have recently been theoretically predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to X-ray heating and ionization.   Aims: We observationally investigate the origin of the neon fine structure line emission by comparing observations with models of X-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empirical correlations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellar parameters. Methods: We select a sample of 28 young stellar objects in the rho Ophiuchi star formation region for which good quality infrared spectra and X-ray data have been obtained, the former with the Spitzer/IRS and the latter with the deep rho Ophiuchi XMM-Newton observation (DROXO). We measure neon line fluxes and X-ray luminosities; we complement these data with stellar/circumstellar parameters obtained by fitting the spectral energy distributions of our objects (from optical to millimeter wavelengths) with star/disk/envelope models.   Results: We detect the [Ne II] and the [Ne III] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively. Line luminosities show no correlation with X-ray emission. The luminosity of the [Ne II] line for one star, and that of both the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines for a second star, match the predictions of published models of X-ray irradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [Ne II] emission is 1-3 dex higher than predicted on the basis of their L_X. However, the stellar/circumstellar characteristics assumed in published models do not match those of most of the stars in our sample. Class I objects show significantly stronger [Ne II] lines than Class II and Class III ones. A correlation is moreover found between the [Ne II] line emission and the disk mass accretion rates estimated from the spectral energy distributions. This might point toward a role of accretion-generated UV emission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to mass inflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated mass outflows (winds and jets).   Conclusions: The X-ray luminosity is clearly not the only parameter that determines the [Ne II] emission. For more exacting tests of X-ray irradiated disk models, these must be computed for the stellar and circumstellar characteristics of the observed objects. Explaining the strong [Ne II] emission of Class I objects likely requires the inclusion in the models of additional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.

	Abstract = {In this first of two companion papers on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), we present our analysis of a 63 ks Chandra HRC-I observation that yielded 742 X-ray detections within the 30'×30' field of view. To facilitate our interpretation of the X-ray image, here we collect a multiwavelength catalog of nearly 2900 known objects in the region by combining 17 different catalogs from the recent literature. We define two reference groups: an infrared sample, containing all objects detected in the K band, and an optical sample comprising low-extinction, well-characterized ONC members. We show for both samples that field object contamination is generally low. Our X-ray sources are primarily low-mass ONC members. The detection rate for optical sample stars increases monotonically with stellar mass from zero at the brown dwarf limit to ~100% for the most massive stars but shows a pronounced dip between 2 and 10 Msolar. We determine LX and LX/Lbol for all stars in our optical sample and utilize this information in our companion paper to study correlations between X-ray activity and other stellar parameters.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We performed a detailed membership selection and studied the accretion properties of low-mass stars in the two apparently very similar young (1-10 Myr) clusters sigma Ori and lambda Ori.   Methods: We observed 98 and 49 low-mass (0.2-1.0 Mo) stars in sigma Ori and lambda Ori respectively, using the multi-object optical spectrograph FLAMES at the VLT, with the high-resolution (R˜ 17 000) HR15N grating (6470-6790 {\AA}). We used radial velocities, Li and Halpha to establish cluster membership and Halpha and other optical emission lines to analyze the accretion properties of members.  Results: We identified 65 and 45 members of the sigma Ori and lambda Ori clusters, respectively, and discovered 16 new candidate binary systems. We also measured rotational broadening for 20 stars and estimated the mass accretion rates in 25 stars of the sigma Ori cluster, finding values between 10-11 and 10-7.7~Mo yr-1 and in 4 stars of the lambda Ori cluster, finding values between 10-11 and 10-10.1~Mo yr-1. Comparing our results with the infrared photometry obtained by the Spitzer satellite, we find that the fraction of stars with disks and the fraction of active disks is larger in the sigma Ori cluster (52$\pm$9% and 78$\pm$16%) than in lambda Ori (28$\pm$8% and 40$\pm$20%).   Conclusions: The different disk and accretion properties of the two clusters could be due either to the effect of the high-mass stars and the supernova explosion in the lambda Ori cluster or to different ages of the cluster populations. Further observations are required to draw a definitive conclusion.  Based on Data collected at the ESO Very Large Telescope, Paranal Observatory, Chile [programs 074.D-0136(A) and 076.C-0125(A)].

	Abstract = {The Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched 1999 July 23, spent its first two months performing On-orbit Activation and Calibration (OAC) activities. This phase of the mission acquired about 40 Ks of data from the young cluster NGC 2516 as part of the boresight and plate-scale measurements of the various instruments. These observations will augment a planned (deeper) GTO observation of this cluster. Here we present the data reduction and analysis techniques needed to make scientific use of these early observations. As many as 100 X-ray detections were found in data returned by the ACIS-I, ACIS-S, HRC-I and HRC-S observations. We assess the absolute position accuracy achieved by comparison with ROSAT detections and optical locations of the same cluster members, and we also discuss the methods employed to obtain reliable photometry of the Chandra sources as observed in all four of Chandra's imaging detectors.

	Abstract = {We present the results of an analysis of Chandra X-ray Observatory data for the open cluster NGC 2516, sometimes referred to as ``the southern Pleiades''. This young, very rich southern open cluster is generally believed to have a metallicity significantly below solar. The study of coronal emission properties of NGC 2516 members allows us to probe the effects of metallicity on the efficiency of dynamo action. Dynamo efficiency is expected to depend on convection zone properties and be strongly affected by metal abundances. Our analysis of both HRC and ACIS images has yielded about 100 X-ray detections. We present the identifications of new X-ray sources with photometric cluster members and compare our new Chandra results with those of ROSAT. We also discuss the X-ray properties of late-type members in comparison with those of corresponding stellar types in the more metal rich approximately coeval Pleiades Cluster.

	Abstract = {We present results of a 63 ksec Chandra HRC-I observation of the Orion Trapezium region. We have detected about 700 distinct sources most of which associated with known Orion Nebula Cluster members. The superb angular resolution of the Chandra mirrors frees our analysis from the source confusion problems that have plagued previous investigations of the X-ray emission of this fascinating region and allow us to explore the relations among X-ray emission levels and other stellar parameters in a large sample of PMS stars. This work is funded in part by NASA contract NAS8-39073 and NASA grant NAS5-4967},

	Abstract = {We propose to observe the candidate young globular cluster Cygnus OB2 for 100ksec with ACIS-I. This region has been found to contain about 2600 OB stars, from which an even larger population of low mass stars is inferred. We estimate that the proposed observation will detect about 2000 stars, putting contraints on the cluster population above one solar mass. Moreover we expect to detect hundreds of stars with shallow convective zones, whose X-ray emission will be studied with unprecedented detail. The X-ray emission of these stars changes abruptly during their evolution, and very few stars in this stage are found in less rich regions. These data will provide important clues to the yet unclear mechanism responsible for the X-ray emission of this class of stars and of PMS stars in general.},

Results obtained in the last decade have shown that the stellar formation process contrarily to previous thoughts is not a ``cool'' process, but instead one where at some stage high-temperature plasma emitting X-rays is present. As a results X-rays are a powerful tracers of star forming activity, and growing evidence is accumulating that they are a crucial ingredient for understanding the complex star formation related phenomena. After briefly sketching our current view of X-ray emission from pre-main sequence stars, we will discuss some recent results obtained with XMM-Newton in the L1551 and Upper Sco-Cen star forming regions.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel result of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP): the detection of rotational modulation of X-ray emission from the Orion Nebula Cluster young stars. This result is made possible by the exceptional length of the COUP observation: 10 days of ACIS integration over a time span of 13 days. We apply the Lomb Periodogram method to the X-ray light curves and find good agreement with published optically determined periods. We note that rotational modulation is often observed in stars with saturated activity levels, indicating a substantial non homogeneity in the spatial distribution of active regions on the surface of these stars. This suggests that saturation is not due to the filling of the stellar surface with active regions.},

	Abstract = {We present results of a Chandra ACIS-I observation of the star forming region NGC 2264. We detect 420 sources in the 17'x17' FOV, most of which associated with low mass and/or embedded young members of NGC 2264. In order to derive the IMF of the region, we estimate masses of X-ray selected members using published optical photometry and evolutionary tracks. The IMF we derive after correcting for incompleteness is likely representative of the optically visible part of NGC 2264. Most of the X-ray undetected members are probably X-ray faint low mass Classical T-Tauri stars already identified in the region with H_alpha  and optical variability studies. Uncertainties in the masses estimated through photometry remain for a small fraction of embedded members. Moreover the X-ray data disclose an additional population of deeply embedded members that is not accounted for in the IMF that we have derived. },

There is a clear relationship between rotation and X-ray activity in older low-mass stars, but exactly when this relationship is established is unclear. Most if not all young low-mass stars form with circumstellar disks. Despite the logical suggestion that circumstellar matter should influence X-ray flux from young stars, there is mixed evidence in the literature of any correlation between circumstellar disks and X-rays. We have obtained Chandra X-ray data of two fields in the Orion Flanking Fields ( 3 Myr) and two fields in NGC 2264 ( 5 Myr). In this poster, we examine whether or not there is any correlations between disks, rotation, and X-rays in these young clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present preliminary results of a detailed X-ray spectral  analysis of 55 sources in the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep field, identified  with late-type stars and having more that 10^4 extracted counts. The aim  of this analysis is to provide a census of element abundances in the coronae of these young stars, and to study possible dependences of such abundances on the magnetic activity level, the presence of circumstellar disks, indicators of accretion, and the properties of the local environment.  We present here the methodology of such an analysis and results related  to the thermal structure of the selected sources, their global metallicity,  and abundance determinations for some individual elements. In particular,  we show that the COUP X-ray bright sources tend to be metal poor (Fe  abundances less than half the solar one, with most frequent values of  0.1-0.2 solar), while they show a larger scatter of Ne abundances, and  Ne/Fe ratios from ˜1 up to ˜10.},

	Abstract = {Luminous, highly variable X-ray emission is one of the defining characteristics of low-mass, pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. A very wide range of temporal behavior has been observed in Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, ranging from rotational modulation, to multiple, non-periodic X-ray bursts, to highly energetic flares lasting hours or days. Building on our recently developed method for unsupervised classification of CCD X-ray spectra (Hojnacki et al. 2007, ApJ, 659, 585), which uses X-ray CCD photon event data to determine natural spectral groupings, we present preliminary results from a study of the combination of variability indicators and raw spectral data for purposes of PMS X-ray source classification. Our objective is to determine the utility of using temporal properties and variability indicators to sort and classify discrete sources of X-ray emission.  This research is supported by NASA under AISRP award NNG04GQ07G and Chandra award AR5-6004X issued by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for and on behalf of NASA under contract NAS8-03060.},

	Abstract = {Accretion disks of T Tauri stars are commonly assumed to be the site where planets form. At the same time, surveys of old planet-host stars -the end product of planet formation- have shown that gas giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. A critical question, with important implications for our understanding of planet formation, is therefore whether metal-rich T Tauri stars exist. In this context, we have started a project aimed at the determination of the metallicity of T Tauri stars in different star forming regions (SFRs): we present the results of a pilot study focusing on a few members of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and Sigma and Lambda Orionis clusters.},

We estimate a low-mass stellar hard X-ray flux in the 20-40 keV band in the range ~7×1031-7×1033 erg/s and speculate the limit of this values. Hard X-ray emission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upper limits for Cygnus OB2. Simbol-X, with its broad energy band (10-100 keV) and its sensitivity should be able to detect this emission and would provide insights into the hard X-ray production of flares on pre-main sequence stars.},

	Abstract = {By extrapolating from observationally derived magnetic surface maps, obtained through Zeeman-Doppler imaging, models of stellar magnetospheres can be constructed. By assuming that the plasma trapped along the closed field lines is in hydrostatic equilibrium, coronal X-ray emission properties, such as the global X-ray emission measure and the amount of rotational modulation of X-ray emission, can be predicted. For pre-main sequence magnetospheres the analysis can be extended to incorporate accretion flows, and predict the amount of softer X-ray emission from accretion spots that would be observed. I will detail the preliminary results of an ambitious multi-wavelength, multi-observing site, and near contemporaneous campaign, combining spectroscopic optical, nIR, UV, X-ray (200ks, Chandra), spectropolarimetric and photometric monitoring of the accreting pre-main sequence star V2129 Oph. Surprisingly the new magnetic map derived from the 2009 data appears to indicate that the surface magnetic field has undergone little evolution since it was previously observed in 2005. The dataset also allows X-ray emission from the stellar corona and the accretion hotspots to be disentangled and crucially allows the validity, and the predictions, of the 3D field topologies derived via field extrapolation to be critically examined.

Constraining the spatial and thermal structure of the gas, and its time evolution, is crucial to understand the star- and planet-formation processes. Models predict that the gas is affected by UV and X-ray radiation from the central young stellar object (YSO), but many uncertainties remain, e.g. whether the EUV emission actually reaches the disk or is absorbed by disk winds. The infrared [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine structure lines at 12.81mum and 15.55mum have been theoretically predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to X-ray heating and ionization.},

YSOs of almost all masses are intense sources of X-rays, with luminosities well above those of main sequence stars. Most of this emission originates in coronae, qualitatively similar to those of the Sun and of other main sequence stars. X-rays are also emitted in shocks at the base of mass accretion funnels and in jets. Diffuse X-ray emission from high mass star forming cloud has also been detected.

	Abstract = {Context: Determining the metal content of low-mass members of young associations provides a tool that addresses different issues, such as triggered star formation or the link between the metal-rich nature of planet-host stars and the early phases of planet formation. The Orion complex is a well known example of possible triggered star formation and is known to host a rich variety of proto-planetary disks around its low-mass stars. Available metallicity measurements yield discrepant results.  Aims: We analyzed FLAMES/UVES and Giraffe spectra of low-mass members of three groups/clusters belonging to the Orion association. Our goal is the homogeneous determination of the metallicity of the sample stars, which allows us to look for [Fe/H] differences between the three regions and for the possible presence of metal-rich stars.   Methods: Nine members of the ONC and one star each in the lambda Ori cluster and OB1b subgroup were analyzed. After the veiling determination, we retrieved the metallicity by means of equivalent widths and/or spectral synthesis using MOOG.  Results: We obtain an average metallicity for the ONC [{Fe/H}] =-0.01$\pm$ 0.04. No metal-rich stars were detected and the dispersion within our sample is consistent with measurement uncertainties. The metallicity of the lambda Ori member is also solar, while the OB1b star has an [Fe/H] significantly below the ONC average. If confirmed by additional [Fe/H] determinations in the OB1b subgroup, this result would support the triggered star formation and the self-enrichment scenario for the Orion complex.

	Abstract = {Context: The Cygnus OB2 association, the central engine of the Cygnus X star-forming region, is the subject of an extensive INTEGRAL Key Project that will accumulate 6Ms of observations. Analysis of 2Ms of observations by De Becker and co-workers provides the most sensitive limit yet obtained on hard X-ray emission from the cluster.   Aims: We investigate the X-ray emission in the 20-40 keV band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in Cygnus OB2. We discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in the interpretation of existing and future X-ray observations of the region, and whether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processes on low-mass pre-main sequence stars.  Methods: The total hard X-ray flux from low-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft X-ray emission stems from a superposition of flares. We further assume the ratio of hard X-ray to soft X-ray emission is described by a scaling found for solar flares by Isola and co-workers.  Results: We estimate the low-mass stellar hard X-ray flux in the 20-40 keV band to lie in the range ~2×1031-6×1032 erg s-1 and discuss some potential biases that might affect this result.  Conclusions: Hard X-ray emission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upper limits for Cygnus OB2. If this emission could be detected, it would provide insight into the hard X-ray production of large flares on pre-main sequence stars. We highlight the penetrating power of hard X-rays from low-mass stellar populations as a possible pointer to our Galaxy's hidden star-forming clusters and super-clusters using more sensitive observations from future missions.},

	Abstract = {We have discovered an optically thick, edge-on circumstellar disk around a Herbig Ae star in the binary system PDS 144, providing the first intermediate-mass analog of HK Tau and similar T Tauri stars. This system consists of a V~13 mag primary and a fainter companion, with the spectra of both stars showing evidence for circumstellar disks and accretion; both stars were classified as Herbig Ae by the Pico dos Dias Survey. In Lick adaptive optics polarimetry, we resolved extended polarized light scattered from dust around the northern star. Follow-up Keck adaptive optics and mid-infrared observations show that this star is entirely hidden by an optically thick disk at all wavelengths from 1.2 to 11.7 mum. The disk major axis subtends ~0.8" on the sky, corresponding to ~800 AU at a distance of 1000 pc. Bright ``wings'' extend 0.3" above and below the disk ansae, due most likely to scattering from the edges of an outflow cavity in a circumstellar envelope. We discuss the morphology of the disk and the spectral energy distributions of the two PDS 144 stars, present preliminary disk models, and identify a number of open questions regarding this fascinating system.  Some of the data presented here were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a global study of low-mass, young stellar object (YSO) surface densities (Sigma) in nearby (<500pc) star-forming regions based on a comprehensive collection of Spitzer Space Telescope surveys. We show that the distribution of YSO surface densities in the solar neighbourhood is a smooth distribution, being adequately described by a lognormal function from a few to 103 YSOs pc-2, with a peak at ~22 stars pc-2 and a dispersion of . We do not find evidence for multiple discrete modes of star formation (e.g. clustered and distributed). Comparing the observed surface density distribution to previously reported surface density threshold definitions of clusters, we find that the fraction of stars in clusters is crucially dependent on the adopted definitions, ranging from 40 to 90 per cent. However, we find that only a low fraction (<26 per cent) of stars are formed in dense environments where their formation/evolution (along with their circumstellar discs and/or planets) may be affected by the close proximity of their low-mass neighbours.},

	Abstract = {We report deep Submillimeter Array observations of 26 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars with evolved inner disks. These observations measure the mass of the outer disk (r~20-100 AU) across every stage of the dissipation of the inner disk (r<10 AU) as determined by the IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find that only targets with high mid-IR excesses are detected and have disk masses in the 1-5 MJup range, while most of our objects remain undetected to sensitivity levels of MDISK~0.2-1.5 MJup. To put these results in a more general context, we collected publicly available data to construct the optical to millimeter wavelength SEDs of over 120 additional PMS stars. We find that the near-IR and mid-IR emissions remain optically thick in objects whose disk masses span 2 orders of magnitude (~0.5-50 MJup). Taken together, these results imply that, in general, inner disks start to dissipate only after the outer disk has been significantly depleted of mass. This provides strong support for photoevaporation being one of the dominant processes driving disk evolution.},

	Abstract = {Context. X-ray observations have proven to be very effective in detecting previously unknown supernova remnant shells around pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and in these cases the characteristics of the shell provide information about the evolutionary stage of the embedded PWN. However, it is not clear why some PWNe are ``naked''.  Aims: We perform an X-ray observational campaign targeting the PWN G54.1+0.3, the ``close cousin'' of the Crab Nebula, to try to detect the associated SNR shell.  Methods: We analyze XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations of G54.1+0.3 to model the contribution of a dust scattering halo.  Results: We detecte an intrinsic faint diffuse X-ray emission surrounding the PWN out to ~ 6' (~10 pc) from the pulsar, characterized by a hard spectrum, which can be modeled with either a power law (gamma = 2.9) or a thermal plasma model (kT = 2.0 keV.)  Conclusions: Assuming the shell to be thermal, we derive an explosion energy E = 0.5-1.6×1051 erg, a pre-shock ISM density of 0.2 cm-3, and an age of ~2000 yr. Using these results in the MHD model of PWN-SNR evolution, we obtain excellent agreement between the predicted and observed location of the shell and PWN shock.},

	Abstract = {The [NeII] fine-structure emission line at 12.8mum has been detected in several young stellar objects spectra. This line is thought to be produced by X-ray irradiation of the warm protoplanetary disc atmospheres; however, the observational correlation between [NeII] luminosities and measured X-ray luminosities shows a large scatter. Such spread limits the utility of this line as a probe of the gaseous phase of discs, as several authors have suggested pollution by outflows as a probable cause of the observed scatter. In this work, we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed [NeII] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disc parameters. In particular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source and the structure (flaring) of the disc have on the luminosity and spectral profile of the [NeII] 12.8 mum line. We find that varying these parameters can indeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminosities which may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhat smaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observed the line with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our models also show that the hardness of the spectrum has only a limited (undetectable) effect on the line profiles, while changes in the flaring power of the disc significantly affect the size of the [NeII] emission region and, as a consequence, its line profile. In particular, we suggest that broad-line profiles centred on the stellar radial velocity may be indicative of flat discs seen at large inclination angles.},

	Abstract = {We have undertaken spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling of discs around low-mass T Tauri stars in order to delineate regions of the infrared two-colour plane (K - [8] versus K - [24]) that correspond to discs in different evolutionary stages. This provides a tool for classifying the nature of star-disc systems based on infrared photometry. In particular, we demonstrate the distinct loci followed by discs that undergo `uniform draining' (reduction in surface density by a spatially uniform factor) from those that clear from the inside-out. We draw attention to the absence of objects on this `draining locus' in those star-forming regions where the 24 -mum sensitivity would permit their detection, as compared with the ~20 objects in these regions with colours suggestive of inner holes. We thus conclude that discs predominantly clear from the inside-out. We also apply our classification of the infrared two-colour plane to stars of spectral types M3-M5 in the IC348 cluster and show that some of its members (dubbed `weak excess' sources by Muzerolle et al.) that had previously been assumed to be in a state of clearing are instead likely to be optically thick discs in which the dust is well settled towards the mid-plane. Nevertheless, there are many discs in a state of partial clearing in IC348, with their abundance (relative to the total population of disc bearing stars) being around four times higher than for comparable stars in Taurus. However, the number of partially cleared discs relative to the total number of late-type stars is similarly low in both regions (10 and 20 per cent, respectively). We therefore conclude that IC348 represents a more evolved version of the Taurus population (with more of its discs being highly settled or partially cleared) but that the time-scale for clearing is similarly short (a few times 105 yr) in both cases.},

	Abstract = {We present self-consistent models of gas in optically thick dusty disks and calculate its thermal, density, and chemical structure. The models focus on an accurate treatment of the upper layers where line emission originates and at radii >~0.7 AU. Although our models are applicable to stars of any mass, we present here only results around ~1 Msolar stars where we have varied dust properties, X-ray luminosities, and UV luminosities. We separately treat gas and dust thermal balance and calculate line luminosities at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths from all transitions originating in the predominantly neutral gas that lies below the very tenuous and completely ionized surface of the disk. We find that the [Ar II] 7 mum, [Ne II] 12.8 mum, [Fe I] 24 mum, [S I] 25 mum, [Fe II] 26 mum, [Si II] 35 mum, [O I] 63 mum, and pure rotational lines of H2 and CO can be quite strong and are good indicators of the presence and distribution of gas in disks. Water is an important coolant in the disk, and many water emission lines can be moderately strong. Current and future observational facilities such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, and SOFIA are capable of detecting gas emission from young disks. We apply our models to the disk around the nearby young star, TW Hya, and find good agreement between our model calculations and observations. We also predict strong emission lines from the TW Hya disk that are likely to be detected by future facilities. We suggest that the gas disk around TW Hya may be truncated to ~120 AU, compared to its dust disk of 174 AU. We speculate that photoevaporation due to the strong stellar FUV field from TW Hya is responsible for the gas disk truncation.},

	Abstract = {We present the first radiation-hydrodynamic model of a protoplanetary disc irradiated with an X-ray extreme ultraviolet (X-EUV) spectrum. In a model where the total ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity, we find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4 × 10-8Msolaryr-1, which is two orders of magnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus, it is clear that the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This can be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger columns (~1022cm-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at larger radius than the EUV. The radial extent of the launching region of the X-ray-heated wind is 1-70au compared with the pure EUV case where the launch region is concentrated around a few au. When we couple our wind mass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as in the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner hole develops at ~1au at the point when the accretion rate in the disc drops below the wind mass-loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is quickly removed in the final 15-20 per cent of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent with the 105yr transitional time-scale estimated from observations of T Tauri stars. We however note several key differences to previous EUV-driven photoevaporation models. The two orders of magnitude higher photoevaporation rate is now consistent with the average accretion rate observed in young stars and will cut the disc off in its prime. Moreover, the extended mass-loss profile subjects the disc to a significant period (~20 per cent of the disc's lifetime) of `photoevaporation-starved accretion'. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to some accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large X-ray luminosity of 2 × 1030ergs-1 further modelling is required in order to investigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray luminosities in T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {We present the time evolution of viscously accreting circumstellar disks as they are irradiated by ultraviolet and X-ray photons from a low-mass central star. Our model is a hybrid of a one-dimensional (1D) time-dependent viscous disk model coupled to a 1+1D disk vertical structure model used for calculating the disk structure and photoevaporation rates. We find that disks of initial mass 0.1 M sun around ~1 M sun stars survive for ~4 × 106 yr, assuming a viscosity parameter alpha = 0.01, a time-dependent FUV luminosity L FUV ~ 10-2-10-3 L sun and with X-ray and EUV luminosities LX ~ L EUV ~ 10-3 L sun. We find that FUV/X-ray-induced photoevaporation and viscous accretion are both important in depleting disk mass. Photoevaporation rates are most significant at ~1-10 AU and at gsim30 AU. Viscosity spreads the disk which causes mass loss by accretion onto the central star and feeds mass loss by photoevaporation in the outer disk. We find that FUV photons can create gaps in the inner, planet-forming regions of the disk (~1-10 AU) at relatively early epochs in disk evolution while disk masses are still substantial. EUV and X-ray photons are also capable of driving gaps, but EUV can only do so at late, low accretion-rate epochs after the disk mass has already declined substantially. Disks around stars with predominantly soft X-ray fields experience enhanced photoevaporative mass loss. We follow disk evolution around stars of different masses, and find that disk survival time is relatively independent of mass for stars with M *lsim 3 M sun; for M *gsim 3 M sun the disks are short-lived (~105 yr).},

	Abstract = {We calculate the rate of photoevaporation of a circumstellar disk by energetic radiation (far-UV (FUV), 6 eV <hnu < 13.6 eV; extreme-UV (EUV), 13.6 eV <hnu < 0.1 keV; and X-rays, hnu>0.1 keV) from its central star. We focus on the effects of FUV and X-ray photons since EUV photoevaporation has been treated previously, and consider central star masses in the range 0.3-7 M sun. Contrary to the EUV photoevaporation scenario, which creates a gap at about rg ~ 7(M */M sun) AU and then erodes the outer disk from inside out, we find that FUV photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the outer disk. Heating by FUV photons can cause significant erosion of the outer disk where most of the mass is typically located. X-rays indirectly increase the mass-loss rates (by a factor of ~2) by ionizing the gas, thereby reducing the positive charge on grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and enhancing FUV-induced grain photoelectric heating. FUV and X-ray photons may create a gap in the disk at ~10 AU under favorable circumstances. Photoevaporation timescales for M * ~ 1 M sun stars are estimated to be ~106 years, after the onset of disk irradiation by FUV and X-rays. Disk lifetimes do not vary much for stellar masses in the range 0.3-3 M sun. More massive stars (gsim7 M sun) lose their disks rapidly (in ~105 years) due to their high EUV and FUV fields. Disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow surface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced by processes such as grain growth or settling. The latter suggests that the photoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves.},

	Abstract = {We present a calculation of the atomic and low-ionization emission line spectra of photoevaporating protoplanetary discs. Line luminosities and profiles are obtained from detailed photoionization calculations of the disc and wind structures surrounding young active solar-type stars. The disc and wind density and velocity fields were obtained from the recently developed radiation-hydrodynamic models of Owen et al. that include stellar X-ray and EUV irradiation of protoplanetary discs at various stages of clearing, from primordial sources to inner hole sources of various hole sizes.  Our models compare favourably with currently available observations, lending support to an X-ray driven photoevaporation model for disc dispersal. In particular, we find that X-rays drive a warm, predominantly neutral flow where the OI 6300 {\AA} line can be produced by neutral hydrogen collisional excitation. Our models can, for the first time, provide a very good match to both luminosities and profiles of the low-velocity component of the OI 6300 {\AA} line and other forbidden lines observed by Hartigan et al., which covered a large sample of T-Tauri stars.  We find that the OI 6300 {\AA} and the NeII 12.8 mum lines are predominantly produced in the X-ray-driven wind and thus appear blueshifted by a few km s-1 for some of the systems when observed at non-edge-on inclinations. We note, however, that blueshifts are only produced under certain conditions: X-ray luminosity, spectral shape and inner hole size all affect the location of the emitting region and the physical conditions in the wind. We caution therefore that while a blueshifted line is a tell-tale sign of an outflow, the lack of a blueshift should not be necessarily interpreted as a lack of outflow. Comparison of spectrally resolved observations of multiple emission lines with detailed model sets, like the one presented here, should provide useful diagnostics of the clearing of gaseous discs.},

	Abstract = {Aims:The aim of this work is to identify the so far unknown low mass stellar population of the ~2 Myr old Cygnus OB2 star forming region, and to investigate the X-ray and near-IR stellar properties of its members. Methods: We analyzed a 97.7 ks Chandra ACIS-I observation pointed at the core of the Cygnus OB2 region. Sources were detected using the PWDetect code and were positionally correlated with optical and near-IR catalogs from the literature. Source events were extracted with the Acis Extract package. X-ray variability was characterized through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and spectra were fitted using absorbed thermal plasma models.  Results: We detected 1003 X-ray sources. Of these, 775 have near-IR counterparts and are expected to be almost all associated with Cygnus OB2 members. From near-IR color-color and color-magnitude diagrams we estimate a typical absorption toward Cygnus OB2 of Av ≈ 7.0 mag. Although the region is young, very few stars (~4.4%) show disk-induced excesses in the near-IR. X-ray variability is detected in ~13% of the sources, but this fraction increases, up to 50%, with increasing source statistics. Flares account for at least 60% of the variability. Despite being generally bright, all but 2 of the 26 detected O- that early B-type stars are not significantly variable. Typical X-ray spectral parameters are log N_H˜ 22.25 (cm-2) and kT˜ 1.35 keV with 1sigma dispersion of 0.2 dex and 0.4 keV, respectively. Variable and flaring sources have harder spectra with median kT= 3.3 and 3.8 keV, respectively. OB stars are typically softer (kT ˜ 0.75 keV). X-ray luminosities range between 1030 and 1031 erg s-1 for intermediate- and low-mass stars, and 2.5×1030 and between 6.3×1033 erg s-1 for OB stars.  Conclusions: .The Cygnus OB2 region has a very rich population of low-mass X-ray emitting stars. Circumstellar disks seem to be very scarce. X-ray variability is related to the magnetic activity of low-mass stars (M/M_o ˜0.5 to 3.0) display X-ray activity levels comparable to those of Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC) sources in the same mass range.

	Abstract = {Aims:We characterize individual and ensemble properties of X-ray flares from stars in the Cygnus OB2 and ONC star-forming regions.  Methods: We analyzed X-ray lightcurves of 1003 Cygnus OB2 sources observed with Chandra for 100 ks and of 1616 ONC sources detected in the ``Chandra Orion Ultra-deep Project'' 850 ks observation. We employed a binning-free maximum likelihood method to segment the light-curves into intervals of constants signal and identified flares on the basis of both the amplitude and the time-derivative of the source luminosity. We then derived and compared the flare frequency and energy distribution of Cygnus OB2 and ONC sources. The effect of the length of the observation on these results was investigated by repeating the statistical analysis on five 100 ks-long segments extracted from the ONC data.  Results: We detected 147 and 954 flares from the Cygnus OB2 and ONC sources, respectively. The flares in Cygnus OB2 have decay times ranging from ⪅0.5 to about 10 h. The flare energy distributions of all considered flare samples are described at high energies well by a power law with index alpha=-(2.1$\pm$0.1). At low energies, the distributions flatten, probably because of detection incompleteness. We derived average flare frequencies as a function of flare energy. The flare frequency is seen to depend on the source's intrinsic X-ray luminosity, but its determination is affected by the length of the observation. The slope of the high-energy tail of the energy distribution is, however, affected little. A comparison of Cygnus OB2 and ONC sources, accounting for observational biases, shows that the two populations, known to have similar X-ray emission levels, have very similar flare activity.  Conclusions: Studies of flare activity are only comparable if performed consistently and taking the observation length into account. Flaring activity does not vary appreciably between the age of the ONC (~1 Myr) and that of Cygnus OB2 (~2 Myr). The slope of the distribution of flare energies is consistent with the micro-flare explanation of the coronal heating.  Full Table 1 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Context. X-rays from very young stars are powerful probes to investigate the mechanisms at work in the very first stages of the star formation and the origin of X-ray emission in very young stars.  Aims: We present results from a 500 ks long observation of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud with a XMM-Newton large program named DROXO, aiming at studying the X-ray emission of deeply embedded young stellar objects (YSOs).  Methods: The data acquired during the DROXO program were reduced with SAS software, and filtered in time and energy to improve the signal to noise of detected sources; light curves and spectra were obtained.  Results: We detected 111 sources, 61 of them associated with rho Ophiuchi YSOs as identified from infrared observations with ISOCAM. Specifically, we detected 9 out of 11 Class I objects, 31 out of 48 Class II and 15 out 16 Class III objects. Six objects out of 21 classified Class III candidates are also detected. At the same time we suggest that 15 Class III candidates that remain undetected at logLx [erg/s] < 28.3 are not related to the cloud population. The global detection rate is ~64%. We have achieved a flux sensitivity of ~5 × 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2. The L_X to L_bol ratio shows saturation at a value of ~-3.5 for stars with T_eff <= 5000 K or 0.7 M_o as observed in the Orion Nebula. The plasma temperatures and the spectrum absorption show a decline with YSO class, with Class I YSOs being hotter and more absorbed than Class II and III YSOs. In one star (GY 266) with infrared counterpart in 2MASS and Spitzer catalogs we have detected a soft excess in the X-ray spectrum, which is best fitted by a cold thermal component less absorbed than the main thermal component of the plasma. This soft component hints at plasma heated by shocks due to jets outside the dense circumstellar material.},

	Abstract = {Context. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray photons from classical T Tauri stars are powerful ionization and heating agents that drive disk chemistry, disk instabilities, and photoevaporative flows. The mid-infrared fine-structure line of [Ne ii] at 12.81 mum has been proposed to trace gas in disk surface layers heated and ionized by stellar X-ray and EUV radiation.  Aims: We aim at locating the origin of [Ne ii] line emission in circumstellar environments by studying distributions of [Ne ii] emission and correlating the inferred [Ne ii] luminosities, L[Ne II], with stellar and circumstellar disk parameters.  Methods: We have conducted a study of [Ne ii] line emission based on a sample of 92 pre-main sequence stars mostly belonging to the infrared Class II, but including 13 accreting transition disk objects, and also 14 objects that drive known jets and outflows.  Results: We find several significant correlations between L[Ne II] and stellar parameters, in particular LX and the wind mass loss rate, dot{M}_loss. Most correlations are, however, strongly dominated by systematic scatter of unknown origin. While there is a positive correlation between L[Ne II] and LX, the stellar mass accretion rate, dot{M}_acc, induces a correlation only if we combine the largely different subsets of jet sources and stars without jets. Our results indeed suggest that L[Ne II] is bi-modally distributed, with separate distributions for the two subsamples. The jet sources show systematically higher L[Ne II], by 1-2 orders of magnitude with respect to objects without jets. Jet-driving stars also tend to show higher mass accretion rates. We therefore hypothesize that the trend with dot{M}_acc only reflects a trend with dot{M}_loss that is more physically relevant for [Ne ii] emission.  Conclusions: The [Ne ii] luminosities measured for objects without known outflows and jets are found to agree with simplified calculations of [Ne ii] emission from disk surface layers if the measured stellar X-rays are responsible for heating and ionizing the gas. The large scatter in L[Ne II] may be introduced by variations of disk properties and the irradiation spectrum, as previously suggested. If these additional factors can be sufficiently well constrained, then the [Ne ii] 12.81 mum line should be an important diagnostic for disk surface ionization and heating, at least in the inner disk region. This applies in particular to transition disks also included in our sample. The systematically enhanced [Ne ii] flux from jet sources clearly suggests a role for the jets themselves, as previously demonstrated by a spatially resolved observation of the outflow system in the T Tau triple.

	Abstract = {Protostars emit more X-rays, hard and soft, than young Sun-like stars in more advanced stages of formation. The X-ray emission becomes harder and stronger during flares. The excess X-rays may arise as a result of the time-dependent interaction of an accretion disk with the magnetosphere of the central star.

	Abstract = {We report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried out toward the Herbig-Haro objects HH 7-11 and HH 54 over the 5.2-37 mum region using the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations have led to the detection and mapping of the S(0)-S(7) pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen, together with emissions in fine-structure transitions of Ne+, Si+, S, and Fe+. The H2 rotational emissions indicate the presence of warm gas with a mixture of temperatures in the range 400-1200 K-consistent with the expected temperature behind nondissociative shocks of velocity ~10-20 km s-1-while the fine-structure emissions originate in faster shocks of velocity ~35-90 km s-1 that are dissociative and ionizing. The H2 ortho-to-para ratio is quite variable, typically falling substantially below the equilibrium value of 3 attained at the measured gas temperatures. The nonequilibrium ortho-to-para ratios are characteristic of temperatures as low as ~50 K, and are a remnant of an earlier epoch, before the gas temperature was elevated by the passage of a shock. Correlations between the gas temperature and H2 ortho-to-para ratio show that ortho-to-para ratios <0.8 are attained only at gas temperatures below ~900 K; this behavior is consistent with theoretical models in which the conversion of para- to ortho-H2 behind the shock is driven by reactive collisions with atomic hydrogen, a process that possesses a substantial activation energy barrier (EA/k~4000 K) and is therefore very inefficient at low temperature. The lowest observed ortho-to-para ratios of only ~0.25 suggest that the shocks in HH 54 and HH 7 are propagating into cold clouds of temperature <~50 K in which the H2 ortho-to-para ratio is close to equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The time evolution of the electromagnetic emission from blazars, in particular high-frequency peaked sources (HBLs), displays irregular activity that has not yet been understood. In this work we report a methodology capable of characterizing the time behavior of these variable objects.  Methods: The maximum likelihood blocks (MLBs) is a model-independent estimator that subdivides the light curve into time blocks, whose length and amplitude are compatible with states of constant emission rate of the observed source. The MLBs yield the statistical significance in the rate variations and strongly suppresses the noise fluctuations in the light curves. We applied the MLBs for the first time on the long term X-ray light curves (RXTE/ASM) of Mkn 421, Mkn 501, 1ES 1959+650, and 1ES 2155-304, more than 10 years of observational data (1996-2007). Using the MLBs interpretation of RXTE/ASM data, the integrated time flux distribution is determined for each single source considered. We identify in these distributions the characteristic level, as well as the flaring states of the blazars. Results: All the distributions show a significant component at negative flux values, most probably caused by an uncertainty in the background subtraction and by intrinsic fluctuations of RXTE/ASM. This effect concerns in particular short time observations. To quantify the probability that the intrinsic fluctuations give rise to a false identification of a flare, we study a population of very faint sources and their integrated time-flux distribution. We determine duty cycle or fraction of time a source spent in the flaring state of the source Mkn 421, Mkn 501, 1ES 1959+650 and 1ES 2155-304. Moreover, we study the random coincidences between flares and generic sporadic events such as high-energy neutrinos or flares in other wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project observed hundreds of young, low-mass stars undergoing highly energetic X-ray flare events. The 32 most powerful cases have been previously modeled with the result that the magnetic structures responsible for these flares can be many stellar radii in extent. In this paper, we model the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these 32 stars in order to determine, in detail for each star, whether there is circumstellar disk material situated in sufficient proximity to the stellar surface for interaction with the large magnetic loops inferred from the observed X-ray flares. Our SEDs span the wavelength range 0.3-8 mum (plus 24 mum for some stars), allowing us to constrain the presence of dusty circumstellar material out to gsim10 AU from the stellar surface in most cases. For 24 of the 32 stars in our sample the available data are sufficient to constrain the location of the inner edge of the dusty disks. Six of these (25%) have SEDs consistent with inner disks within reach of the observed magnetic loops. Another four stars may have gas disks interior to the dust disk and extending within reach of the magnetic loops, but we cannot confirm this with the available data. The remaining 14 stars (58%) appear to have no significant disk material within reach of the large flaring loops. Thus, up to ~40% of the sample stars exhibit energetic X-ray flares that possibly arise from a magnetic star-disk interaction, and the remainder are evidently associated with extremely large, free-standing magnetic loops anchored only to the stellar surface.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic reconnection events in the atmospheres of low-mass dwarf stars can be classified as either slow or fast, depending on whether ohmic diffusion or Hall currents dominate in the reconnection process. We suggest that the separation of reconnection into slow and fast categories can help to explain some systematics of low-mass dwarfs as regards their emissions in X-rays, Halpha, and radio. On the one hand, in the warmer dwarfs (<M7), where electrical resistivities are small, fast reconnection is permitted, and this can explain the occurrence of flares and "quiescent" coronal heating. On the other hand, the fact that the coolest dwarfs (>M7) are inefficient emitters in Halpha and X-rays but strong emitters in radio, may be understood in the context that only slow reconnection is permitted to occur in those stars, as a result of high electrical resistivity. However, even though only slow reconnection is permitted in the latter stars, the speed of the outflow jets from reconnection sites can serve as efficient sources of radio emission as a result of the electron cyclotron maser instability.},

	Abstract = {We present new models for the X-ray photoevaporation of circumstellar disks which suggest that the resulting mass loss (occurring mainly over the radial range 10-40 AU) may be the dominant dispersal mechanism for gas around low-mass pre-main-sequence stars, contrary to the conclusions of previous workers. Our models combine use of the MOCASSIN Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and a self-consistent solution of the hydrostatic structure of the irradiated disk. We estimate the resulting photoevaporation rates assuming sonic outflow at the surface where the gas temperature equals the local escape temperature and derive mass-loss rates of ~10-9 M sun yr-1, typically a factor of 2-10 times lower than the corresponding rates in our previous work where we did not adjust the density structure of the irradiated disk. The somewhat lower rates, and the fact that mass loss is concentrated toward slightly smaller radii, result from the puffing up of the heated disk at a few AU which partially screens the disk at tens of AU. Our mass-loss fluxes agree with those of Alexander et al. but we differ from Alexander et al. in our assessment of the overall significance of X-ray photoevaporation, given the large disk radii (and hence emitting area) associated with X-ray-driven winds. Gorti & Hollenbach, on the other hand, predict considerably lower mass-loss fluxes than either Alexander et al. or ourselves and we discuss possible reasons for this difference. We highlight the fact that X-ray photoevaporation has two generic advantages for disk dispersal compared with photoevaporation by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photons that are only modestly beyond the Lyman limit: the demonstrably large X-ray fluxes of young stars even after they have lost their disks and the fact that X-rays are effective at penetrating much larger columns of material close to the star. We however stress that our X-ray-driven mass-loss rates are considerably more uncertain than the corresponding rates for EUV photoevaporation (around 10-10 M sun yr-1) and that this situation will need to be remedied through future radiation hydrodynamical simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present results from an X-ray imaging survey of the young cluster NGC 2264, carried out with the European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC) on board the XMM-Newton spacecraft. The X-ray data are merged with extant optical and near-infrared photometry, spectral classifications, Halpha emission strengths, and rotation periods to examine the interrelationships between coronal and chromospheric activity, rotation, stellar mass, and internal structure for a statistically significant sample of pre-main-sequence stars. A total of 300 distinct X-ray sources can be identified with optical or near-infrared counterparts. The sources are concentrated within three regions of the cluster: in the vicinity of S Mon, within the large emission/reflection nebulosity southwest of S Mon, and along the broad ridge of molecular gas that extends from the Cone Nebula to the NGC 2264 IRS 2 field. From the extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram of the cluster, ages and masses for the optically identified X-ray sources are derived. A median age of ~2.5 Myr and an apparent age dispersion of ~5 Myr are suggested by pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. The X-ray luminosity of the detected sources appears well correlated with bolometric luminosity, although there is considerable scatter in the relationship. Stellar mass contributes significantly to this dispersion, while isochronal age and rotation do not. X-ray luminosity and mass are well correlated such that LX ~ (M/Modot)1.5, similar to the relationship found within the younger Orion Nebula Cluster. No strong evidence is found for a correlation between EH-K, the near-infrared color excess, and the fractional X-ray luminosity, which suggests that optically thick dust disks have little direct influence on the observed X-ray activity levels. Among the X-ray-detected weak-line T Tauri stars, the fractional X-ray luminosity, LX/Lbol, is moderately well correlated with the fractional Halpha luminosity, LHalpha/Lbol, but only at the 2 sigma level of significance. The cumulative distribution functions for the X-ray luminosities of the X-ray-detected classical and weak-line T Tauri stars within the cluster are comparable, assuming the demarcation between the two classes is at an Halpha equivalent width of 10 {\AA}. However, if the nondetections in X-rays for the entire sample of Halpha emitters known within the cluster are taken into account, then the cumulative distribution functions of these two groups are clearly different, such that classical T Tauri stars are underdetected by at least a factor of 2 relative to the weak-line T Tauri stars. Examining a small subsample of X-ray-detected stars that are probable accretors based on the presence of strong Halpha emission and near-infrared excess, we conclude that definitive nonaccretors are ~1.6 times more X-ray luminous than their accreting counterparts. In agreement with earlier published findings for the Orion Nebula Cluster, we find a slight positive correlation (valid at the 2 sigma confidence level) between LX/Lbol and rotation period in NGC 2264. The lack of a strong anticorrelation between X-ray activity and rotation period in the stellar population of NGC 2264 suggests that either the deeply convective T Tauri stars are rotationally saturated or the physical mechanism responsible for generating magnetic fields in pre-main-sequence stars is distinct from the one that operates in evolved main-sequence stars.},

	Abstract = {Context. The young cluster NGC 2264 was observed with the CoRoT satellite for 23 days uninterruptedly in March 2008 with unprecedented photometric accuracy. We present the first results of our analysis of the accreting population belonging to the cluster as observed by CoRoT.  Aims: We search for possible light curve variability of the same nature as that observed in the classical T Tauri star AA Tau, which was attributed to a magnetically controlled inner disk warp. The inner warp dynamics is supposed to be directly associated with the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner disk region.  Methods: We analyzed the CoRoT light curves of 83 previously known classical T Tauri stars that belong to NGC 2264 classifying them according to their light-curve morphology. We also studied the CoRoT light-curve morphology as a function of a Spitzer-based classification of the star-disk systems.  Results: The classification derived on the basis of the CoRoT light-curve morphology agrees very well with the Spitzer IRAC-based classification of the systems. The percentage of AA Tau-like light curves decreases as the inner disk dissipates, from 40% $\pm$ 10% in systems with thick inner disks to 36% $\pm$ 16% in systems with anemic disks and zero in naked photosphere systems. Indeed, 91% $\pm$ 29% of the CTTS with naked photospheres exhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% $\pm$ 7% of the thick disk systems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free of variable obscuration.  Conclusions: AA Tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common, with a frequency of at least ~30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks. The temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of the inner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for the obscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~1-3) rotational periods. This probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-disk magnetospheric interaction.  The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.Table 1 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present X-ray spectral analysis of the accreting young star TW Hydrae from a 489 ks observation using the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating. The spectrum provides a rich set of diagnostics for electron temperature Te , electron density Ne , hydrogen column density NH , relative elemental abundances, and velocities, and reveals its source in three distinct regions of the stellar atmosphere: the stellar corona, the accretion shock, and a very large extended volume of warm postshock plasma. The presence of Mg XII, Si XIII, and Si XIV emission lines in the spectrum requires coronal structures at ~10 MK. Lower temperature lines (e.g., from O VIII, Ne IX, and Mg XI) formed at 2.5 MK appear more consistent with emission from an accretion shock. He-like Ne IX line ratio diagnostics indicate that Te = 2.50 $\pm$ 0.25 MK and Ne = 3.0 $\pm$ 0.2 × 1012 cm-3 in the shock. These values agree well with standard magnetic accretion models. However, the Chandra observations significantly diverge from current model predictions for the postshock plasma. This gas is expected to cool radiatively, producing O VII as it flows into an increasingly dense stellar atmosphere. Surprisingly, O VII indicates Ne = 5.7+4.4 -1.2 × 1011 cm-3, 5 times lower than Ne in the accretion shock itself and ~7 times lower than the model prediction. We estimate that the postshock region producing O VII has roughly 300 times larger volume and 30 times more emitting mass than the shock itself. Apparently, the shocked plasma heats the surrounding stellar atmosphere to soft X-ray emitting temperatures and supplies this material to nearby large magnetic structures---which may be closed magnetic loops or open magnetic field leading to mass outflow. Our model explains the soft X-ray excess found in many accreting systems as well as the failure to observe high Ne signatures in some stars. Such accretion-fed coronae may be ubiquitous in the atmospheres of accreting young stars.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of X-ray stellar activity from the age of the youngest known star forming regions (SFR), la 1 Myr, to about 100 Myr, i.e. the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) for a  ~ 1 Msun star. We consider five SFR of varying age (rho  Ophiuchi, the Orion Nebula Cluster, NGC 2264, Chamaeleon I, and eta  Chamaeleontis) and two young clusters (the Pleiades and NGC 2516). Optical and X-ray data for these regions are retrieved both from archival observations and recent literature, and reanalyzed here in a consistent manner so as to minimize systematic differences in the results.  We study trends of LX and LX/Lbol as a function of stellar mass and association age. For low mass stars (M <~ 1 Msun) we observe an increase in LX/Lbol in the first 3-4 Myr and a subsequent leveling off at the saturation level (LX/Lbol  ~ -3). Slowly evolving very low mass stars then retain saturated levels down to the oldest ages here considered, while for higher mass stars activity begins to decline at some age after  ~ 107 years.  We find our data consistent with the following tentative picture: low mass PMS stars with no circumstellar accretion disk have saturated activity, consistently with the activity-Rossby number relation derived for MS stars. Accretion and/or the presence of disks somehow lowers the observed activity levels; disk dissipation and/or the decrease of mass accretion rate in the first few Myrs of PMS evolution is therefore responsible for the observed increase of LX/Lbol with time.

	Abstract = {X-ray spectra from stellar coronae are reprocessed by the underlying photosphere through scattering and photoionization events. While reprocessed X-ray spectra reaching a distant observer are at a flux level of only a few percent of that of the corona itself, characteristic lines formed by inner shell photoionization of some abundant elements can be significantly stronger. The emergent photospheric spectra are sensitive to the distance and location of the fluorescing radiation and can provide diagnostics of coronal geometry and abundance. Here we present Monte Carlo simulations of the photospheric Kalpha1,alpha2 doublet arising from quasi-neutral Fe irradiated by a coronal X-ray source. Fluorescent line strengths have been computed as a function of the height of the radiation source, the temperature of the ionizing X-ray spectrum, and the viewing angle. We also illustrate how the fluorescence efficiencies scale with the photospheric metallicity and the Fe abundance. Based on the results we make three comments: (1) fluorescent Fe lines seen from pre-main-sequence stars mostly suggest flared disk geometries and/or supersolar disk Fe abundances; (2) the extreme ~1400 m{\AA} line observed from a flare on V1486 Ori could be explained entirely by X-ray fluorescence if the flare itself were partially eclipsed by the limb of the star; and (3) the fluorescent Fe line detected by Swift during a large flare on II Peg is consistent with X-ray excitation and does not require a collisional ionization contribution. There is no convincing evidence supporting the energetically challenging explanation of electron impact excitation for observed stellar Fe Kalpha lines.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the W. M. Keck I Telescope of seven low-mass T Tauri stars (LMTTs) and brown dwarfs in Taurus-Auriga. The observed Li I 6708 {\AA} absorption, low surface gravity signatures, and radial velocities confirm that all are members of the Taurus star-forming region; no new spectroscopic binaries are identified. Four of the seven targets observed appear to be T Tauri brown dwarfs. Of particular interest is the previously classified ``continuum T Tauri star'' GM Tau, which has a spectral type of M6.5 and possibly a substellar mass. These spectra, in combination with previous high-resolution spectra of LMTTs, are used to understand the formation and early evolution of objects in Taurus-Auriga with masses near and below the stellar/substellar boundary. None of the LMTTs in Taurus are rapidly rotating (vsini<30 km s-1), unlike low-mass objects in Orion. Many of the slowly rotating, nonaccreting stars and brown dwarfs exhibit prominent Halpha emission (equivalent widths of 3-36 {\AA}), indicative of active chromospheres. We demonstrate empirically that the full width at 10% of the Halpha emission profile peak is a more practical and possibly more accurate indicator of accretion than either the equivalent width of Halpha or optical veiling: 10% widths >270 km s-1 are classical T Tauri stars (i.e., accreting), independent of stellar spectral type. Although LMTTs can have accretion rates comparable to that of more typical, higher mass T Tauri stars (e.g., K7-M0 spectral types), the average mass accretion rate appears to decrease with decreasing mass. A functional form of M~M is consistent with the available data, but the dependence is difficult to establish because of both selection biases in observed samples and the decreasing frequency of active accretion disks at low masses (M<0.2 Msolar). The diminished frequency of accretion disks for LMTTs, in conjunction with their lower, on average, mass accretion rates, implies that they are formed with less massive disks than higher mass T Tauri stars. The radial velocities, circumstellar properties, and known binaries do not support the suggestion that many of the lowest mass members of Taurus have been ejected from higher stellar density regions within the cloud. Instead, LMTTs appear to have formed and are evolving in the same way as higher mass T Tauri stars, but with smaller disks and shorter disk lifetimes.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the efficiency of iron K line emission and iron K absorption in photoionized models using a new set of atomic data. These data are more comprehensive than those previously applied to the modeling of iron K lines from photoionized gases and allow us to systematically examine the behavior of the properties of line emission and absorption as a function of the ionization parameter, density, and column density of model constant density clouds. We show that, for example, the net fluorescence yield for the highly charged ions is sensitive to the level population distribution produced by photoionization, and these yields are generally smaller than those predicted assuming the population is according to statistical weight. We demonstrate that the effects of the many strongly damped resonances below the K ionization thresholds conspire to smear the edge, thereby potentially affecting the astrophysical interpretation of absorption features in the 7-9 keV energy band. We show that the centroid of the ensemble of Kalpha lines, the Kbeta energy, and the ratio of the Kalpha1 to Kalpha2 components are all diagnostics of the ionization parameter of our model slabs.},

	Abstract = {A wide field imager attached to the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope on La Silla has been used to monitor the Orion Nebula Cluster on 45 nights between 25 Dec. 1998 and 28 Feb. 1999. Ninety-two images were obtained during this period through an intermediate band filter centered at 815.9 nm. More than 1500 sources with I magnitudes between 12.5 and 20 were monitored. We find that essentially every star brighter than 16th mag (where the precision is <0.01 mag) is a variable, with about half having a peak-to-peak variation of ~ 0.2 mag or more. A clear correlation is found between the level of variability and infrared excess emission, in the sense that stars with evidence for circumstellar disks have larger amplitudes of variation. A search for periodic variables was carried out and 369 such stars were discovered, most or all of which are rotating, spotted T Tauri stars. Periodic variables are most commonly found among the low amplitude variables. 46% of the stars with magnitudes between 12.5 and 16 and standard deviation, sigma < 0.1 mag, were found to be periodic, whereas only 24% of the stars in the same magnitude range with sigma > 0.1 yielded periods. Our work confirms the existence of a bimodal period distribution, with peaks near 2 and 8 days, for stars with M > 0.25 Msun and a unimodal distribution peaked near 2 days, for lower mass stars. We show that a statistically significant correlation exists between infrared excess emission and rotation in the sense that slower rotators are more likely to show evidence of circumstellar disks. Slowly rotating stars, with angular velocities, omega < 1 radian/d, corresponding to rotation periods longer than 6.28 d, have a mean infrared excess emission, Delta (I-K) = 0.55 +/- 0.05, indicative of the presence of inner disks, while rapid rotators, with omega > 2 radians/d, corresponding to rotation periods shorter than 3.14 d, have a much smaller mean of 0.17 +/- 0.05. This supports the hypothesis that disks are involved in regulating stellar rotation during the pre-main sequence phase. We explore a simple and commonly adopted model of rotational evolution in which stars conserve angular velocity while locked to a disk and conserve angular momentum once released. If these assumptions are valid, and if the locking period is 8 days, we find that more than half of the stars in the ONC are no longer locked to disks and that an exponential decay model with a disk-locking half-life of about 0.5-1 My fits the observations well. Assuming that the mean ages of the higher and lower mass stars are the same, the faster rotation of the lower mass stars can be understood as either a consequence of a shorter disk-locking time or a shorter initial disk-locking period, or both.

	Abstract = {Rotation periods are now available for ~500 pre-main-sequence (PMS) and recently arrived main-sequence stars of solar-like mass (0.4-1.2 Msolar) in five nearby young clusters: the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC), NGC 2264, alpha Per, IC 2602, and the Pleiades. In combination with estimates of stellar radii these data allow us to construct distributions of surface angular momentum per unit mass at three different epochs: nominally, 1, 2, and 50 Myr. There are sufficient data that rotational evolution can now be discussed statistically on the basis of the evolution of these distributions, not just on the evolution of means or ranges, as has been necessary in the past. Our main result is illustrated in Figure 18 and may be summarized as follows: (1) 50%-60% of the stars on convective tracks in this mass range are released from any locking mechanism very early on and are free to conserve angular momentum throughout most of their PMS evolution, i.e., to spin up and account for the rapidly rotating young main-sequence stars; (2) the other 40%-50% lose substantial amounts of angular momentum during the first few million years and end up as slowly rotating main-sequence stars. The duration of the rapid angular momentum loss phase is ~5-6 Myr, which is roughly consistent with the lifetimes of disks estimated from infrared surveys of young clusters. The rapid rotators of Orion age lose less than 10% of their (surface) specific angular momentum during the next 50 Myr, while the slow rotators lose about two-thirds of theirs. A detectable part of this loss occurs even during the ~1 Myr interval between the ONC and NGC 2264. The data support the view that interaction between an accretion disk and star is the primary mechanism for evolving the broad, bimodal distribution of rotation rates seen for solar-like stars in the ONC into the even broader distributions seen in the young MS clusters.},

	Abstract = {Context: We present new high-resolution spectroscopic observations for 91 pre-main sequence stars in the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC) with masses in the range 0.10-0.25~M_o carried out with the multi-fiber spectrograph flames attached to the UT2 at the Paranal Observatory. Aims: Our aim is to better understand the disk-locking scenario in very low-mass stars. Methods: We have derived radial velocities, projected rotational velocities, and full width at 10% of the Halpha emission peak. Using published measurements of infrared excess (Delta(I_C-K)), as disk tracer and equivalent width of the nead-infrared Ca II line lambda8542, mid-infrared difference [3.6]-[8.0] mum derived by Spitzer data, and 10% Halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we looked for any correlation between projected angular rotational velocity divided by the radius (v sin i/R) and presence of disk and accretion. Results: For 4 low-mass stars, the cross-correlation function is clearly double-lined, indicating that the stars are SB2 systems. The distribution of rotation periods derived from our v sin i measurements is unimodal with a peak of a few days, in agreement with previous results for M<0.25~M_o. The photometric periods were combined with our v sin i to derive the equatorial velocity and the distribution of rotational axes. Our <  sin i> is lower than the one expected for a random distribution, as previously found. We find no evidence of a population of fast rotators close to the break-up velocity. A clear correlation between v sin i/R and Delta(I_C-K) has been found. While a spread in the rotation rates is seen for stars with no circumstellar disk (Delta(I_C-K)<0.3), stars with a circumstellar disk (Delta(I_C-K)>0.3) show an abrupt drop in their rotation rates by a factor of ~5. On the other hand, only a partial correlation between v sin i and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. The X-ray coronal activity level (log L_X/L_bol) shows no dependence on v sin i/R, suggesting that all stars are in a saturated regime limit. The critical velocity is probably below our v sin i detection limit of 9 km s-1. Conclusions: The ONC low-mass stars in our sample, close to the hydrogen burning limit, at present do not seem to be locked, but the clear correlation we find between rotation and infrared color excess suggests that they were locked once. In addition, the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.  Based on the flames Science Verification proposal 60.A-9145(A) and the flames proposal 76.C-0524(A).

In this ``locked'' state, the spin-up torque balances the spin-down torque so that the net average torque on the star is zero. We investigated two types of initial conditions: (I) a relatively weak stellar magnetic field and a high coronal density and (II) a stronger stellar field and a lower coronal density. We observed that for both initial conditions the rotation of the star is locked to the rotation of the disk. In the second case, the radial field lines carry significant angular momentum out of the star. However, this did not appreciably change the condition for locking of the rotation of the star. We find that in the equilibrium state the corotation radius rco is related to the magnetospheric radius rA as rco/rA~1.2-1.3 for case I and rco/rA~1.4-1.5 for case II. We estimated periods of rotation in the equilibrium state for classical T Tauri stars, dwarf novae, and X-ray millisecond pulsars.},

	Abstract = {We report the findings of a comprehensive study of disk accretion and related phenomena in four of the nearest young stellar associations spanning 6-30 million years in age, an epoch that may coincide with the late stages of planet formation. We have obtained ~650 multiepoch high-resolution optical spectra of 100 low-mass stars that are likely members of the eta Chamaeleontis (~6 Myr), TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta Pictoris (~12 Myr), and Tucanae-Horologium (~30 Myr) groups. Our data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 December and 2005 July on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope. Based on Halpha line profiles, along with a variety of other emission lines, we find clear evidence of ongoing accretion in 3 out of 11 eta Cha stars and 2 out of 32 TW Hydrae members. None of the 57 beta Pic or Tuc-Hor members shows measurable signs of accretion. Together, these results imply significant evolution of the disk-accretion process within the first several Myr of a low-mass star's life. While a few disks can continue to accrete for up to ~10 Myr, our findings suggest that disks accreting for beyond that timescale are rather rare. This result provides an indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in inner disks and, in turn, on gas-giant planet formation. All accretors in our sample are slow rotators, whereas nonaccretors cover a large range in rotational velocities. This may hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8 Myr. Our multiepoch spectra confirm that emission-line variability is common even in somewhat older T Tauri stars, among which accretors tend to show particularly strong variations. Thus, our results indicate that accretion and wind activity undergo significant and sustained variations throughout the lifetime of accretion disks.},

	Abstract = {We critically examine the theory of disk locking, which assumes that the angular momentum deposited on an accreting protostar is exactly removed by torques carried along magnetic field lines connecting the star to the disk. In this Letter, we consider that the differential rotation between the star and disk naturally leads to an opening (i.e., disconnecting) of the magnetic field between the two. We find that this significantly reduces the spin-down torque on the star by the disk. Thus, disk locking cannot account for the slow rotation (~10% of breakup speed) observed in several systems and for which the model was originally developed.},

	Abstract = {Aims. We investigate the accretion process from an accretion disk onto a magnetized rotating star with a purely dipolar magnetic field. Our main aim is to study the mechanisms that regulate the stellar angular momentum. In this work, we consider two effects that can contrast with the spin-up torque normally associated with accretion: (1) the spin-down torque exerted by an extended magnetosphere connected to the disk beyond the corotation radius; (2) the spin-down torque determined by a stellar wind flowing along the opened magnetospheric field lines. Methods: Our study is based on time-dependent axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of the interaction between a viscous and resistive accretion disk with the dipolar magnetosphere of a rotating star. We present the first example of a numerical experiment able to model at the same time the formation of accretion curtains, the effects of an extended stellar magnetosphere and the launching of a stellar wind. Results: In the examples presented, the spin-down torque related to the star-disk interaction can extract only ˜10% of the accretion torque, due to the weakness of the extended connection. Not even the spin-down torque exerted by a stellar wind is strong enough (˜20%): despite a huge lever arm (RA ≈ 19 R_star), the mass-loss rate (dot{M}_wind ≈ 1% dot{M}_acc) is too low to provide an efficient torque. Conclusions: We argue that, at least in the case of typical classical T Tauri stars (dot{M}_acc ≈ 10-8 M_o yr-1, Bstar, dipole ⪅ 1 kG) rotating at 10% of their break-up speed, the disk spin-down is unlikely to balance the accretion torque (``disk locked'' equilibrium). A massive stellar wind (dot{M}_wind ≈ 20% dot{M}_acc) could in principle succeed, but its mass and energy fluxes are quite demanding, both from a theoretical and an observational point of view.},

We confirm that U-V excess is well correlated with the Halpha equivalent width for the stars in our sample. We show that for the more massive stars in the cluster sample (roughly 0.4-1.2 Msolar), there is also a significant association between U-V excess and rotation, in the sense that slow rotators are more likely to show excess U-band emission and variability. This constitutes significant new evidence in support of the disk-locking paradigm.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed a number of intense X-ray flares observed in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a 13 day observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), concentrating on the events with the highest statistics (in terms of photon flux and event duration). Analysis of the flare decay allows to determine the physical parameters of the flaring structure, particularly its size and (using the peak temperature and emission measure of the event) the peak density, pressure, and minimum confining magnetic field. A total of 32 events, representing the most powerful ~=1% of COUP flares, have sufficient statistics and are sufficiently well resolved to grant a detailed analysis. A broad range of decay times are present in the sample of flares, with taulc (the 1/e decay time) ranging from 10 to 400 ks. Peak flare temperatures are often very high, with half of the flares in the sample showing temperatures in excess of 100 MK. Significant sustained heating is present in the majority of the flares. The magnetic structures that are found, from the analysis of the flare's decay, to confine the plasma are in a number of cases very long, with semilengths up to ~=1012 cm, implying the presence of magnetic fields of hundreds of G (necessary to confine the hot flaring plasma) extending to comparable distance from the stellar photosphere. These very large sizes for the flaring structures (length L>>R*) are not found in more evolved stars, where, almost invariably, the same type of analysis results in structures with L<=R*. As the majority of young stars in the ONC are surrounded by disks, we speculate that the large magnetic structures that confine the flaring plasma are actually the same type of structures that channel the plasma in the magnetospheric accretion paradigm, connecting the star's photosphere with the accretion disk.},

	Abstract = {We present results from high-resolution spectra of 237 stars in the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC) obtained during two engineering runs with the Hectochelle multifiber echelle spectrograph on the 6.5 m MMT. The ONC is the nearest populous young (age~1 Myr) cluster and is therefore an important object for studies of the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Using the high spectral resolution of Hectochelle, we are able to distinguish stellar accretion and wind emission-line profiles from nebular emission lines and identify accreting members of the cluster from Halpha profiles with greater accuracy than previously possible. We find 15 new members on the basis of Li lambda6707 absorption and Halpha emission. Line profiles of Halpha of some objects that are not too contaminated by nebular emission show features characteristic of mass inflow and ejection. We also present rotational velocities as part of an initial investigation into angular momentum evolution of very young stars, confirming a difference between classical T Tauri stars and weak-line T Tauri stars that had been found from period analysis. Finally, we present an initial study of the radial velocity dispersion of the brighter stars in the central cluster. The very small dispersion derived, <=1.8 km s-1, is in good agreement with estimates from proper motions.  Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {We present a kinematic study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based upon RVs measured by multifiber echelle spectroscopy at the 6.5 m MMT and Magellan telescopes. Velocities are reported for 1613 stars, with multi-epoch data for 727 objects as part of our continuing effort to detect and analyze spectroscopic binaries (SBs). We confirm and extend the results of Furesz et al. showing that the ONC is not relaxed, consistent with its youth, and that the stars generally follow the position-velocity structure of the moderate density gas in the region, traced by 13CO. The additional RVs we have measured enable us to probe some discrepancies between stellar and gaseous structure which can be attributed to binary motion and the inclusion of nonmembers in our kinematic sample. Our multi-epoch data allow us to identify 89 SBs; more will be found as we continue monitoring. Our results reinforce the idea that the ONC is a cluster in formation, and thus provide a valuable testing ground for theory. In particular, our observations are not consistent with the quasi-equilibrium or slow contraction models of cluster formation, but are consistent with cold collapse models.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {We measured lithium in a sample of low-mass stars (~0.1-0.3 Msolar) of the Orion Nebula cluster. We find evidence for significant Li depletion in four high-probability members, corresponding to nuclear ages between ~15 and 30 Myr. In two cases, there is excellent agreement between the mass and age based on models of Li burning and those derived from the H-R diagram, reinforcing our early findings. For the two other stars, the nuclear age is significantly larger than the isochronal one. Several Li-depleted stars display accretion activity, veiling, and emission lines. We discuss empirical evidence in favor of the old nuclear age and the implications on the star formation history of the Orion cluster.

We report the discovery of a significant depletion of lithium in four stars with estimated masses of ~0.4 Msolar and ages ~10 Myr. Comparison with the predictions of numerical and analytical models shows excellent agreement between the isochronal age and lithium depletion timescale for two objects, the first such case for lithium-poor pre-main-sequence stars. Our results bear on the issue of the real age spread in the ONC and hence on the overall duration of the star formation process, indicating that the stellar population did not come into existence in a single, rapid burst.

	Abstract = {Context. Star formation theories are currently divergent regarding the fundamental physical processes that dominate the substellar regime. Observations of nearby young open clusters allow the brown dwarf (BD) population to be characterised down to the planetary mass regime, which ultimately must be accommodated by a successful theory.  Aims: We hope to uncover the low-mass population of the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud and investigate the properties of the newly found brown dwarfs.  Methods: We used near-IR deep images (reaching completeness limits of approximately 20.5 mag in J and 18.9 mag in H and Ks) taken with the Wide Field IR Camera (WIRCam) at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) to identify candidate members of rho Oph in the substellar regime. A spectroscopic follow-up of a small sample of the candidates allows us to assess their spectral type and subsequently their temperature and membership.  Results: We select 110 candidate members of the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud, from which 80 have not previously been associated with the cloud. We observed a small sample of these and spectroscopically confirm six new brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M6.5 to M8.25.  Based on observations obtained with WIRCam, a joint project of CFHT, Taiwan, Korea, Canada, France, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {Aims: While observational evidence shows that most of the decline in a star's X-ray activity occurs between the age of the Hyades (~ 8 × 108 yr) and that of the Sun, very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between these ages. To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star's intermediate age, we studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr old open cluster NGC 752.  Methods: We analysed a ~140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. We detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra's field-of-view are detected in the X-ray. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived.  Results: Our data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity of the cluster members with M=0.8-1.2~Mo is LX = 1.3 × 1028 erg s-1, so approximately a factor of 6 less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that LX is proportional to the square of a star's rotational rate, the median LX of NGC 752 is consistent, for t ⪆ 1 Gyr, to a decaying rate in rotational velocities v_rot ∝ t-alpha with alpha ˜ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~= 0.5) and significantly steeper than observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha <0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at t˜ 1 Gyr.

	Abstract = {We report on a systematic search for X-ray emission from pre-main sequence and young main sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga-Perseus region. Our stellar sample consists of all T Tauri stars from the Taurus-Auriga region, and all late-type stars from the Pleiades and Hyades clusters which have been observed by the ROSAT PSPC in pointed observations. We present the X-ray parameters for all observed stars in tables. Next to the basic results of the data analysis (such as count rates, exposure time, and off-axis angle) we give X-ray luminosities and hardness ratios for all detected stars. Upper limits are given for non-detections. Detection rates for different spectral types are compiled. We use these results to study the connection between coronal X-ray activity and stellar parameters for different subgroups of our sample. In particular we compile X-ray luminosity functions (XLF), and discuss the relations between X-ray emission and spectral type, age, and rotation, which have been disputed extensively in the past. Here, we study these questions with the largest sample so far. The XLF for classical and weak-line T Tauri stars are different, with weak-lines being the stronger X-ray emitters. Proceeding towards the main-sequence (Pleiades, Hyades) the X-ray luminosity declines for all spectral types examined (G, K, and M stars). Within an age group Lx decreases towards later spectral types, while Lx/Lbol remains constant or even increases, reflecting the opposed influence of stellar radius, i.e. emitting area, and convection zone depth. For a given spectral type the fastest rotators show the highest X-ray luminosity. Rotation rate and X-ray emission are clearly correlated for all groups of stars with power law indices for log(Lx/Lbol) versus lg{Prot} of ~ -0.7 to -1.5. The study of XLF for binary stars shows that the known unresolved secondaries likely contribute a significant amount to the X-ray emission.

	Abstract = {Herbig-Haro (HH) objects have been known for 50 years to be luminous condensations of gas in star-forming regions, but their underlying physical nature is still being elucidated. Previously suggested models encompass newborn stars, stellar winds clashing with nebular material, dense pockets of interstellar gas excited by shocks from outflows, and interstellar `bullets' (ref. 6). Recent progress has been made with the jet-induced shock model, in which material streams out of young stellar objects and collides with the surrounding interstellar medium. A clear prediction of this model is that the most energetic Herbig-Haro objects will emit X-rays, although they have not hitherto been detected. Here we report the discovery of X-ray emission from one of the brightest and closest Herbig-Haro objects, HH2, at a level consistent with the model predictions. We conclude that this Herbig-Haro object contains shock-heated material located at or near its leading edge with a temperature of about 106K.},

	Abstract = {X-ray emission from massive stellar outflows has been detected in several cases. We present a Chandra observation of HH 168 and show that the soft X-ray emission from a plasma of 0.55 keV within HH 168 is diffuse. The X-ray emission is observed on two different scales: Three individual, yet extended, regions are embedded within a complex of low X-ray surface brightness. Compared to the bow shock the emission is displaced against the outflow direction. We show that there is no significant contribution from young stellar objects (YSOs) and discuss several shock scenarios that can produce the observed signatures. We establish that the X-ray emission of HH 168 is excited by internal shocks in contrast to simple models, which expect the bow shock to be the most X-ray luminous.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection during the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) of two soft, constant, and faint X-ray sources associated with the Herbig-Haro object HH 210. HH 210 is located at the tip of the NNE finger of the emission line system bursting out of the BN-KL complex, northwest of the Trapezium cluster in the OMC-1 molecular cloud. Using a recent Halpha image obtained with the ACS imager on board HST, and taking into account the known proper motions of HH 210 emission knots, we show that the position of the brightest X-ray source, COUP 703, coincides with the emission knot 154-040a of HH 210, which is the emission knot of HH 210 having the highest tangential velocity (425 km s-1). The second X-ray source, COUP 704, is located on the complicated emission tail of HH 210 close to an emission line filament and has no obvious optical/infrared counterpart. Spectral fitting indicates for both sources a plasma temperature of ~0.8 MK and absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities of about 1030 erg s-1 (0.5-2.0 keV). These X-ray sources are well explained by a model invoking a fast-moving, radiative bow shock in a neutral medium with a density of ~12 000 cm-3. The X-ray detection of COUP 704 therefore reveals, in the complicated HH 210 region, an energetic shock not yet identified at other wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {As members of the instrument team for the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and as Chandra General Observers, we have developed a wide variety of data analysis methods that we believe are useful to the Chandra community, and have constructed a significant body of publicly available software (the ACIS Extract package) addressing important ACIS data and science analysis tasks. This paper seeks to describe these data analysis methods for two purposes: to document the data analysis work performed in our own science projects and to help other ACIS observers judge whether these methods may be useful in their own projects (regardless of what tools and procedures they choose to implement those methods). The ACIS data analysis recommendations we offer here address much of the workflow in a typical ACIS project, including data preparation, point source detection via both wavelet decomposition and image reconstruction, masking point sources, identification of diffuse structures, event extraction for both point and diffuse sources, merging extractions from multiple observations, nonparametric broadband photometry, analysis of low-count spectra, and automation of these tasks. Many of the innovations presented here arise from several, often interwoven, complications that are found in many Chandra projects: large numbers of point sources (hundreds to several thousand), faint point sources, misaligned multiple observations of an astronomical field, point source crowding, and scientifically relevant diffuse emission.},

Besides the confirmation of all the 10 known HH objects in the rho Oph cloud core (Reipurth, published in 1999), seven groups of HH objects, including HH 548, 549A-C, 550, 551, 552, 553A-E, and 554, are newly discovered in the off-core regions. The newly found HH objects concentrate in three regions, which are 2-3 pc away from the rho Oph dark cloud core. Among these, the three brightest objects, HH 549, 550, and 551, show characteristic HH morphologies of shock or knot with tail. HH 553 and 554 are located in the L1689N region, but they are unlikely driven by the well-known protostar IRAS 16293-2422. HH 550 and 551 are located more than 1 pc away from the cloud and possibly form a parsec-scale HH flow in Ophiuchus.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of outflow activity in a sample of 45 low-luminosity embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). We use maps in the J=2-1 line of ^12^CO to characterize this activity for YSOs that are still sufficiently embedded to show molecular outflows. Our CO outflow survey benefits from coordinated millimeter continuum measurements of circumstellar masses which allow us to estimate the evolutionary states of the central driving sources. Our sample comprises 36 near-IR (Class I) protostars and 9 far-IR/submm (Class 0) protostars, and should be representative of the ``self-embedded'' phase of (low-mass) protostellar evolution characterizing young stars still surrounded by significant circumstellar envelopes. We find that virtually all the objects in our sample have detectable CO outflow activity. We make homogeneous estimates of the outflow momentum flux deposited in the close environment of the driving sources in order to assess the dynamical properties of the underlying driving winds/jets. As is well-known, a tight correlation between outflow energetics and driving source luminosity is found for Class I sources. However, Class 0 sources lie a factor of ~10 above this correlation, suggesting they have qualitatively different (e.g., more powerful) CO outflows. In addition, we find that the outflow momentum flux correlates well with the circumstellar envelope mass of the exciting source for both Class I and Class 0 sources. We show that this new correlation is independent of the F_CO_-L_bol_ correlation and most likely results from a more or less continuous decrease of outflow power with time during the accretion phase. For a young star of final mass ~0.6Msun_, the outflow momentum flux is typically F_CO_~10^-4^Msun_.km/s/yr at the early Class 0 stage and F_CO_~2x10^-6^Msun_.km/s/yr at the late Class I stage. We suggest that this decrease of outflow energetics reflects a corresponding decay in the mass accretion/infall rate.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a near-infrared 2.12 mum survey covering a large portion of the rho Ophiuchi cloud (three regions of ~20'×20' each, on average) in an effort to improve the detection of embedded molecular hydrogen emission objects in the cloud. We complement these observations with deep optical [S II] images of six areas of 10'×10' each. We recovered all previously known optical jets/Herbig-Haro (HH) objects as well as H2 outflows in the region and report the detection of four new HH objects and 13 near-infrared knots. We provide coordinates and describe the morphology of these knots, several of which are identified as belonging to the same flow on the basis of morphological and proximity arguments. We discuss likely exciting sources. A unique association of the driving star is not always possible, as several young stars lie in close proximity to these knots.

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution mid-infrared observations of the nearby late-type young binary system Hen 3-600. The binary, at a distance of ~50 pc, could be a member of the TW Hydrae association, the nearest known group of young stars, with an age of a few million years. Our images make it possible for the first time to determine which star in the pair, separated by 1.4", harbors the mid-infrared excess detected by IRAS. In the near-infrared, where the radiation is primarily photospheric, Hen 3-600A (M3) and Hen 3-600B (M3.5) have a flux ratio of 1.6. At 4.8, 10.8, and 18.2 mum, the primary becomes increasingly dominant over the secondary, suggesting that most of the circumstellar dust in the system resides around Hen 3-600A. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Hen 3-600A to the median SED of classical T Tauri stars suggests that its disk may be truncated by the secondary and provides tentative evidence for a central disk hole. The distribution of dust in the Hen 3-600 system may provide important clues to the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks in close binaries.},

	Abstract = {We present a census of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have obtained images of Chamaeleon I at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 mum. To search for new disk-bearing members of the cluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors in these data. Through this work, we have discovered four new members of Chamaeleon I with spectral types of M4, M6, M7.5, and L0. The first three objects are highly embedded (AJ~5) and reside near known protostars, indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster (tau<1 Myr). The L0 source is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I. Its luminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 Msolar, making it the least massive brown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. To characterize the disk population in Chamaeleon I, we have classified the infrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that are encompassed by the Spitzer images. Through these classifications, we find that the disk fraction in Chamaeleon I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3 Msolar. These data are similar to the disk fraction of IC 348, which is a denser cluster at the same age as Chamaeleon I. However, the disk fraction at M>~1 Msolar is significantly higher in Chamaeleon I than in IC 348 (65% vs. 20%), indicating longer disk lifetimes in Chamaeleon I for this mass range. Thus, low-density star-forming regions like Chamaeleon I may offer more time for planet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.

Three of the other new members may have edge-on disks, based on the shapes of their infrared spectral energy distributions. One of the possible edge-on systems has a steeply rising slope from 4.5 to 24 mum, indicating that it could be a Class I source (star+disk+envelope) rather than a Class II source (star+disk).

	Abstract = {We analyze samples of Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of T Tauri stars in the Ophiuchus, Taurus, and Chamaeleon I star-forming regions, whose median ages lie in the <1-2 Myr range. The median mid-infrared spectra of objects in these three regions are similar in shape, suggesting, on average, similar disk structures. When normalized to the same stellar luminosity, the medians follow each other closely, implying comparable mid-infrared excess emission from the circumstellar disks. We use the spectral index between 13 and 31 mum and the equivalent width of the 10 mum silicate emission feature to identify objects whose disk configuration departs from that of a continuous, optically thick accretion disk. Transitional disks, whose steep 13-31 mum spectral slope and near-IR flux deficit reveal inner disk clearing, occur with about the same frequency of a few percent in all three regions. Objects with unusually large 10 mum equivalent widths are more common (20%-30%); they could reveal the presence of disk gaps filled with optically thin dust. Based on their medians and fraction of evolved disks, T Tauri stars in Taurus and Chamaeleon I are very alike. Disk evolution sets in early, since already the youngest region, the Ophiuchus core (L1688), has more settled disks with larger grains. Our results indicate that protoplanetary disks show clear signs of dust evolution at an age of a few Myr, even as early as ~1 Myr, but age is not the only factor determining the degree of evolution during the first few million years of a disk's lifetime.},

	Abstract = {We present 5-40 mum Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of a collection of transitional disks, objects for which the spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates central clearings (holes) or gaps in the dust distribution, in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Like their counterparts in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region that we have previously observed, the spectra of these young objects (1-3 Myr old) reveal that the central clearings or gaps are very sharp-edged, and are surrounded by optically thick dusty disks similar to those around other classical T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon I association. Also like the Taurus transitional disks, the Chamaeleon I transitional disks have extremely large depletion factors for small dust grains in their gaps, compared to the full accretion disks whose SEDs are represented by the median SED of Class II objects in the region. We find that the fraction of transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I cloud is somewhat higher than that in the Taurus-Auriga cloud, possibly indicating that the frequency of transitional disks, on average, increases with cluster age. We also find a significant correlation between the stellar mass and the radius of the outer edge of the gap. We discuss the disk structures implied by the spectra and the constraints they place on gap-formation mechanisms in protoplanetary disks.},

	Abstract = {Context: T Tauri stars exhibit variability on all timescales, whose origin is still debated.  Aims: We investigate the long term variability of CTTs over up to 20 years, characterize it from a set of statistical parameters and discuss its origin.  Methods: We present a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements for Classical T Tauri stars extending up to 20 years. The database contains more than 21 000 UBVR observations of 72 CTTs. All the data were collected within the framework of the ROTOR-program at Mount Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and together they constitute the longest homogeneous, accurate record of TTS variability ever assembled. We characterize the long term photometric variations of 49 CTTs with sufficient data to allow a robust statistical analysis and propose an empirical classification scheme.  Results: Several patterns of long term photometric variability are identified. The most common pattern, exhibited by a group of 15 stars which includes T Tau itself, consists of low level variability (Delta V<=0.4 mag) with no significant changes occurring from season to season over many years. A related subgroup of 22 stars exhibits a similar stable long term variability pattern, though with larger amplitudes (up to Delta V~=1.6 mag). Besides these representative groups, we identify three smaller groups of 3-5 stars each which have distinctive photometric properties. Conclusions: The long term variability of most CTTs is fairly stable and merely reflects shorter term variability due to cold and hot surface spots. Only a small fraction of CTTs undergo significant brightness changes on the long term (months, years), which probably arise from slowly varying circumstellar extinction.},

	Abstract = {Context: T Tauri stars exhibit variability on all timescales, whose origin is still debated. On WTTS the variability is fairly simple and attributed to long-lived, ubiquitous cool spots.  Aims: We investigate the long term variability of WTTS, extending up to 20 years in some cases, characterize it statistically and discuss its implications for our understanding of these stars.  Methods: We have obtained a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements for WTTS extending up to 20 years. It contains more than 9000 UBVR observations of 48 WTTS. All the data were collected at Mount Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and they constitute the longest homogeneous record of accurate WTTS photometry ever assembled.  Results: Definitive rotation periods for 35 of the 48 stars are obtained. Phased light curves over 5 to 20 seasons are now available for analysis. Light curve shapes, amplitudes and colour variations are obtained for this sample and various behaviors exhibited, discussed and interpreted.  Conclusions: Our main conclusion is that most WTTS have very stable long term variability with relatively small changes of amplitude or mean light level. The long term variability seen reflects modulation in the cold spot distributions. Photometric periods are stable over many years, and the phase of minimum light can be stable as well for several years. On the long term, spot properties do change in subtle ways, leading to secular variations in the shape and amplitudes of the light curves.

	Abstract = {Context:  X-ray surveys carried out with the Einstein and ROSAT satellites have resulted in rather unexpected detections of X-ray emission from late B-type and early A-type stars. These stars possess neither winds like early-type stars nor convective envelopes as late-type stars, so that the origin and production mechanism of this X-emission is unclear.   Aims:  We investigate whether the presence of large magnetic fields is related to the observed X-ray emission. Methods:  We carried out Chandra high-angular resolution observations of a sample of late B-type and A-type stars with measured magnetic fields in the range from 0.2-17 kG. Out of the selected 10 sample stars, 6 objects had been previously detected as X-ray sources, some of them, however, with high positional uncertainty and a low signal-to-noise ratio, while 4 of our sample stars do have large magnetic fields but no previous detections of X-ray emission.   Results:  Our Chandra data confirm all previous ROSAT detections with an extremely high significance, and the limits of the offsets between X-ray and optical positions are greatly improved. In particular, HD 215441, known as Babcock's star with the strongest magnetic field by far (17 kG) of our sample stars, a rather faint and somewhat marginal ROSAT source, can clearly be detected. However, none of the 4 ROSAT non-detections could be detected with the new Chandra observations.   Conclusions: . The pure existence of a magnetic field of kiloGauss strength on a late B-type or A-type star is therefore not necessarily a prerequisite for finding X-ray emission among these stars. Understanding the observed X-ray emission from Babcock's star is a challenge for observational and theoretical astrophysics.},

	Abstract = {Context: Classical T Tauri stars (hereafter CTTS) show a plethora of in- and outflow signatures in a variety of wavelength bands.  Aims: In order to constrain gas velocities and temperatures, we analyse the emission in the hot ion lines.  Methods: We use all available archival FUSE spectra of CTTS to measure the widths, fluxes and shifts of the detected hot ion lines and complement these data with HST/GHRS and HST/STIS data. We present theoretical estimates of the temperatures reached in possible emission models such as jets, winds, disks and accretion funnels and look for correlations with X-ray lines and absorption properties. Results: We find line shifts in the range from -170 km s-1 to +100 km s-1. Most linewidths exceed the stellar rotational broadening. Those CTTS with blue-shifted lines also show excess absorption in X-rays. CTTS can be distinguished from main sequence (hereafter MS) stars by their large ratio of the O VII to O VI luminosities.  Conclusions: No single emission mechanism can be found for all objects. The properties of those stars with blue-shifted lines are compatible with an origin in a shock-heated dust-depleted outflow.},

	Abstract = {We present new measurements of disk accretion rates for T Tauri stars in the Taurus molecular cloud complex. Our results are based on intermediate-resolution spectrophotometry from 3200 to 5200 A, which is used to derive the excess hot continuum emission produced by accretion onto the central star. Previous estimates of T Tauri accretion rates in the literature differ by as much as 1 order of magnitude; our measurements agree better with the lowest estimates, and we discuss the problems and systematic effects that led to the previous disagreement. In particular, we note that the stellar photospheric emission from nonaccreting T Tauri stars exhibits color anomalies compared to main-sequence stars; these anomalies make the estimated extinction depend upon the color index used. We argue that the V-R index is a reasonable compromise to match with optically derived spectral types, and that V-I and V-J are much more likely to be biased by cooler companion stars and starspots. We develop a calibration with which approximate mass accretion rates can be derived for T Tauri stars based on broadband photometry and spectral types, which should enable accretion rates to be estimated for large samples with greater ease.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, new Cousins VRI data are presented for NGC 752 and Praesepe, and new and extant data are combined into an augmented database for M67. For those three clusters, catalogs containing Cousins VRI photometry, reddening-corrected values of (V-K)J, and temperatures are produced. The same is done for Coma by using both previously published and newly derived Cousins photometry. An extant set of catalogs for the Hyades is updated to include V magnitudes and values of (R-I)C that were published after the original catalogs appeared. Finally, M67 V magnitudes published previously by Sandquist are corrected for an effect that depends on location on the face of the cluster. The corrected data and values of (V-I)C given by Sandquist are then set out in a supplementary catalog. Data files containing all of these catalogs are deposited in the CDS archives. To assess the quality of the data in the catalogs, the consistency of extant Cousins VRI databases is tested by performing analyses with the following features: (1) quantities as small as a few millimags are regarded as meaningful; (2) statistical analysis is applied; (3) no use is made of data other than VRI measurements and comparable results; (4) no inferences are drawn from color-magnitude comparisons; (5) pertinent data that have not been included previously are analyzed; and (6) results based on direct comparisons of stellar groups at the telescope are featured. In this way, it is found that our updated M67 color data and those of Sandquist are on the E region zero point. In contrast, values of (V-I)C from Montgomery and collaborators are found to be too red by 27+/-3 mmag, with an even larger offset being likely for unpublished data from Richer and his collaborators. Zero-point tests of our Cousins VRI colors for Coma, Praesepe, and NGC 752 are also satisfactory. Scale factor tests of the M67 colors are performed, and a likely scale factor error in the Montgomery et al. colors is found. However, it appears at present that the scale factors of our M67 colors and those of Sandquist are satisfactory. For the most part, zero-point tests of the assembled V magnitudes are also satisfactory, although it is found that further work on the V magnitudes for Praesepe and M67 would be useful. To put these results in perspective, it is pointed out that photometric tests that are satisfactory at the few-millimag level have been published for some two decades and so are not appearing for the first time in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Context: Although several attempts have been made to identify solar-type members on the main sequence of the nearby open cluster Coma Berenices (Mel 111), the population of the lower main sequence is still poorly known.  Aims: We observed 46 new candidates to search for new members and monitored known spectroscopic-binary members to determine orbital parameters.  Methods: We obtained a total of 903 radial-velocity measurements of 69 solar-type stars in the field of Mel 111 with the CORAVEL spectrovelocimeter over 20 years.  Results: Among the 35 stars from Trumpler's list, 23 are members according to their radial velocities and photometry. We were able to confirm the membership of only 8 stars among the 46 candidates observed. Six double-lined and ten single-lined spectroscopic binaries were discovered. Six only are members and an orbit was determined for them and for 4 double-lined non-members. The binary frequency is 22% (7/32). The cluster mean radial velocity is +0.01 $\pm$ 0.08 km s-1 based on 28 members. Conclusions: The lower main sequence of the Coma Berenices open cluster is still rather poorly populated. The cluster size may be much larger that usually accepted. Accordingly extensive programmes to determine precise proper motions, radial velocities and photometry should be undertaken to identify faint cluster members outside the cluster central area. If a significant population of faint members cannot be identified, Coma Ber could be a prominent example of dynamical evolution leading to star evaporation.

	Abstract = {The large-scale, steady-state magnetic field configuration of the solar corona is typically computed using boundary conditions derived from photospheric observations. Two approaches are typically used: (1) potential field source surface (PFSS) models, and (2) the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. The former have the advantage that they are simple to develop and implement, require relatively modest computer resources, and can resolve structure on scales beyond those that can be handled by current MHD models. However, they have been criticized because their basic assumptions are seldom met. Moreover, PFSS models cannot directly incorporate time-dependent phenomena, such as magnetic reconnection, and do not include plasma or its effects. In this study, we assess how well PFSS models can reproduce the large-scale magnetic structure of the corona by making detailed comparisons with MHD solutions at different phases in the solar activity cycle. In particular, we (1) compute the shape of the source surface as inferred from the MHD solutions to assess deviations from sphericity, (2) compare the coronal hole boundaries as determined from the two models, and (3) estimate the effects of nonpotentiality. Our results demonstrate that PFSS solutions often closely match MHD results for configurations based on untwisted coronal fields (i.e., when driven by line-of-sight magnetograms). It remains an open question whether MHD solutions will differ more substantially from PFSS solutions when vector magnetograms are used as boundary conditions. This will be addressed in the near future when vector data from SOLIS, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar-B become incorporated into the MHD models.},

	Abstract = {The flux and line shape of the fine-structure transitions of Ne II and Ne III at 12.8 and 15.55 mum and of the forbidden transitions of O I lambda6300 are calculated for young stellar objects with a range of mass-loss rates and X-ray luminosities using the X-wind model of jets and the associated wide-angle winds. For moderate and high accretion rates, the calculated Ne II line luminosity is comparable to or much larger than produced in X-ray irradiated disk models. All of the line luminosities correlate well with the main parameter in the X-wind model, the mass-loss rate, and also with the assumed X-ray luminosity---and with one another. The line shapes of an approaching jet are broad and have strong blue-shifted peaks near the effective terminal velocity of the jet. They serve as a characteristic and testable aspect of jet production of the neon fine-structure lines and the O I forbidden transitions.},

	Abstract = {We present new subarcsecond (~0farcs7) Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum emission from circumstellar disks around 11 low- and intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars. High-resolution observations for three additional sources were obtained from the literature. In all cases the disk emission is spatially resolved. We adopt a self-consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on spatial scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear to be correlated with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from ~20 AU to ~100 AU over about 5 Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that our sample disks form an evolutionary sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the temporal evolution of a viscous alpha-disk, we estimate (1) that at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60% of the circumstellar material was located inside radii of 25-40 AU, (2) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4 M sun, and (3) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models tightly link the surface density Sigma(R) with the radial profile of the disk viscosity nu(R) vprop R gamma. We find values of gamma ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in the observed disks. Adopting the alpha parameterization for the viscosity, we argue that alpha must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may vary between 0.5 and 10-4. From the inferred disk initial radii we derive specific angular momenta, j, for parent cores of (0.8 - 4) × 10-4 km s-1 pc. Comparison with the values of j in dense cores suggests that about 10% of core angular momentum and 30% of the core mass are conserved in the formation of the star/disk system. We demonstrate that the similarity solution for the surface density for gamma < 0 can explain the properties of some "transitional disks" without requiring discontinuities in the disk surface density. In the case of LkCa 15, a smooth distribution of material from few stellar radii to about 240 AU can produce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the spatially resolved continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. Finally we show that among the observed sample, TW Hya is the only object that has a disk radius comparable with the early solar nebula.},

	Abstract = {The inner boundary of protoplanetary discs is structured by the dramatic opacity changes at the transition from the dust-containing to a dust-free zone. This paper explores the variety and limits of inner rim structures in passively heated dusty discs. For this study, we implemented detailed sublimation physics in a fast Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. We show that the inner rim in dusty discs is not an infinitely sharp wall but a diffuse region which may be narrow or wide. Furthermore, high surface densities and large silicate grains as well as iron and corundum grains decrease the rim radius, from a 2.2 AU radius for small silicates around a 47~Lo Herbig Ae star typically to 0.4 AU and as close as 0.2 AU. A passive disc with grain growth and a diverse dust composition must thus have a small inner rim radius. Finally, an analytical expression is presented for the rim location as a function of dust, disc and stellar properties.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a method based on wavelet transforms (WTs) to detect sources in astronomical images obtained with photon-counting detectors, such as X-ray images. The WT is a multiscale transform that is suitable for detection and analysis of interesting image features (sources) spanning a range of sizes. This property of the WT is particularly well suited to the case in which the point-spread function is strongly varying across the image, and it is also effective in the detection of extended sources. The method allows one to measure source count rates, sizes, and ellipticity, with their errors. Care has been taken in the assessment of thresholds for detection, in the WT space, at any desired confidence level, through a detailed semianalytical study of the statistical properties of noise in wavelet-transformed images. The method includes the use of exposure maps to handle sharp background gradients produced by a nonuniform exposure across the detector, which would otherwise yield many spurious detections. The same method is applied to evaluate upper limits to the count rate of undetected objects in the field of view, allowing a sensitivity map for each observation to be constructed.},

	Abstract = {Aims.This paper's goal is to improve the member census of the NGC 2264 star-forming region and study the origin of X-ray activity in young PMS stars. Methods: .We analyze a deep, 100 ks long, Chandra ACIS observation covering a 17'×17' field in NGC 2264. The preferential detection in X-rays of low-mass PMS stars gives strong indications of their membership. We study X-ray activity as a function of stellar and circumstellar characteristics by correlating the X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and absorptions with optical and near-infrared data from the literature. Results: .We detect 420 X-ray point sources. Optical and NIR counterparts are found in the literature for 85% of the sources. We argue that more than 90% of these counterparts are NGC 2264 members, thereby significantly increasing the known low-mass cluster population by about 100 objects. Among the sources without counterpart, about 50% are probably associated with members, several of which we expect to be previously unknown protostellar objects. With regard to activity we confirm several previous findings: X-ray luminosity is related to stellar mass, although with a large scatter; L_X/L_bol is close to, but almost invariably below, the saturation level, 10-3, especially when considering the quiescent X-ray emission. A comparison between CTTS and WTTS shows several differences: CTTS have, at any given mass, activity levels that are both lower and more scattered than WTTS; emission from CTTS may also be more time variable and is on average slightly harder than for WTTS. However, we find evidence in some CTTS of extremely cool, ˜0.1-0.2 keV, plasma which we speculate is heated by accretion shocks. Conclusions: .Activity in low-mass PMS stars, while generally similar to that of saturated MS stars, may be significantly affected by mass accretion in several ways: accretion is probably responsible for very soft X-ray emission directly produced in the accretion shock; it may reduce the average energy output of solar-like coronae, at the same time making them hotter and more dynamic. We briefly speculate on a physical scenario that can explain these observations.},

	Abstract = {We present results from 1078 high-resolution spectra of 990 stars in the young open cluster NGC 2264, obtained with the Hectochelle multiobject echelle spectrograph on the 6.5 m MMT. We confirm 471 stars as members on the basis of their radial velocity and/or Halpha emission. The radial velocity distribution of cluster members is non-Gaussian, with a dispersion of sigma~3.5 km s-1. We find a substantial north-south velocity gradient and spatially coherent structure in the radial velocity distribution, similar to that seen in the molecular gas in the region. Our results suggest that there are at least three distinguishable subclusters in NGC 2264, correlated with similar structure seen in 13CO emission, which is likely to be a remnant of initial structure in this very young cluster. We propose that this substructure is the result of gravitational amplification of initial inhomogeneities during overall collapse to a filamentary distribution of gas and stars, as found in simulations by Burkert & Hartmann (2004).  Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {An Halpha emission survey of the young cluster NGC 2264 in the Mon OB1 association resulted in the detection of 490 Halpha emission stars in a 25'×40' field approximately centered between the O7 V multiple star S Mon and the Cone Nebula. The survey was carried out with the wide-field grism spectrograph (WFGS) on the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope on Mauna Kea. X-ray observations made with the European Photon Imaging Camera on board the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite observatory will be discussed in a subsequent paper. Optical (BVRCIC) photometry was obtained for selected fields to supplement similar data from the literature. Spectra covering the 6000-8000 {\AA} region at a resolution of R~3000 (adequate for the determination of Li I lambda6708 line strengths) were obtained for 150 Halpha and X-ray emission sources with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. Near-infrared spectra (1-2.5 mum) of a number of T Tauri stars (TTSs), X-ray sources, and LHalpha25 (W90) were also obtained using SpeX on the Infrared Telescope Facility. Ages and masses for the Halpha emitters were inferred from the isochrones and evolutionary tracks of D'Antona & Mazzitelli. The median age for the TTS population is about 1.1 Myr, but a considerable dispersion, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, exists for individual objects. Several fields in the cluster were observed with the WFGS on more than one occasion, permitting an examination of Halpha variability over long baselines in time. About 90% of the classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) showed changes in W(Halpha) of at least 10%, while 57% varied at levels of 50% or more. No evidence was found for a significant pool of dormant Halpha emitters. Summing the masses of the TTSs and the OB stellar population of NGC 2264, a lower limit for the total stellar mass content of the cluster is about 430 Msolar. This is less than 1% of the total mass of the atomic and molecular gas believed to be associated with NGC 2264. Evidence for hierarchical structure within the cluster is suggested by the spatial distribution of TTSs. Four concentrations of Halpha emitters are evident: two near S Mon and two near the Cone Nebula. The median age of the TTSs in the immediate vicinity of S Mon was found to be greater than that of the TTSs near Allen's infrared source (IRS-1), but a significant dispersion is present. From the rotational data of Lamm et al. and Makidon et al., 241 of the TTSs are periodic variables, 150 weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) and 91 CTTSs, while 123 stars are irregular variables (30 WTTSs and 93 CTTSs). A weak-to-moderate positive correlation is found between H-K color and Prot for the CTTSs, in the sense that stars having longer periods tend to have larger H-K colors. A similar positive correlation is found between LHalpha and Prot among the CTTSs. No statistically significant correlation is found between Prot and theoretical age or between Prot and LX. Other topics discussed include the fraction of Halpha emitters that are WTTSs, f(WTTS)=N(WTTS)/N(TTS), for clusters of different ages; the relative detectability of Halpha emission using WFGS and narrowband filter imaging techniques; and the correlation of W(Li I) with Te, age, H-K color, and W(Halpha).},

	Abstract = {We present the results of an extensive search for periodic and irregular variable pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the young (2-4 Myr) open cluster NGC 2264, based on photometric monitoring using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the 2.2 m telescope on La Silla (Chile). In total, about 10 600 stars with IC magnitudes between 9.8 mag and 21 mag have been monitored in our 34 arcmin × 33 arcmin field. Time series data were obtained in the IC band in 44 nights between Dec. 2000 and March 2001; altogether we obtained 88 data points per star. Using two different time series analysis techniques (Scargle periodogram and CLEAN) we found 543 periodic variable stars with periods between 0.2 days and 15 days. Also, 484 irregular variable stars were identified using a chi2-test. In addition we have carried out nearly simultaneous observations in V, RC and a narrow-band Halpha filter. The photometric data enable us to reject background and foreground stars from our sample of variable stars according to their location in the IC vs. (RC-IC) colour-magnitude and (RC-Halpha) vs. (RC-IC) colour-colour diagrams. We identified 405 periodic variable and 184 irregular variable PMS stars as cluster members using these two different tests. In addition 35 PMS stars for which no significant variability were detected could be identified as members using an Halpha emission index criterion. This yields a total of 624 PMS stars in NGC 2264, of which only 182 were previously known. Most of the newly found PMS stars are fainter than IC ~= 15 mag and of late spectral type (⪆M 2). We find that the periodic variables, as a group, have a smaller degree of variability and smaller Halpha index than the irregular variables. This suggests that the sample of periodic variables is biased towards weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) while most of the irregular variables are probably classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We have quantified this bias and estimated that the expected fraction of WTTSs among PMS stars in the cluster is 77%. This is relatively close to the fraction of WTTSs among the periodic variables which is 85%. We also estimated the total fraction of variables in the cluster using only two well selected concentrations of PMS stars called NGC 2264 N & S in which we can easily estimate the total number of PMS stars. We find that at least 74% of the PMS stars in the cluster with IC<= 18.0 mag were found to be variable (either periodic or irregular) by our study. This number shows that our search for PMS stars in NGC 2264 through extensive and accurate photometric monitoring is very efficient in detecting most PMS stars down to at least IC=18.0 mag.

	Abstract = {We present a database of BVRI time-series photometry of the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with two ground-based telescopes at different longitudes to provide simultaneous coverage with the 13 day Chandra observation of the cluster. The resulting database of simultaneous optical and X-ray light curves for some 800 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars represents, by a factor of hundreds, the largest synoptic, multi-wavelength-regime, time-series study of young stars to date. This database will permit detailed analyses of the relationship between optical and X-ray variability among a statistically significant ensemble of PMS stars, with the goal of elucidating the origins of PMS X-ray production. In this first paper, we present the optical observations, describe the combined X-ray/optical database, and perform an analysis of time-correlated variability in the optical and X-ray light curves. We identify 40 stars (representing 5% of our study sample) with possible time-correlated optical and X-ray variability. Examples of both positive and negative time correlations are found, possibly representing X-ray flares and persistent coronal features associated with both cool and hot surface spots (i.e., magnetically active regions and accretion shocks). We also find two possible examples of ``white-light'' flares coincident with X-ray flares; these may correspond to the impulsive heating phase in solar-analog flares. However, although interesting, these represent unusual cases. More generally, we find very little evidence to suggest a direct causal link between the sources of optical and X-ray variability in PMS stars. The conclusion that accretion is a primary driver of X-ray production in PMS stars is not supported by our findings.  This study is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP).},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical analysis of simultaneous optical and X-ray light curves, spanning 600 ks, for 814 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster. The aim of this study is to establish the relationship, if any, between the sites of optical and X-ray variability and thereby to elucidate the origins of X-ray production in PMS stars. In a previous paper, we showed that optical and X-ray variability in PMS stars are very rarely time-correlated. Here, using time-averaged variability indicators to examine the joint occurrences of optical and X-ray variability, we confirm that the two forms of variability are not directly causally related. However, a strong and highly statistically significant correlation is found between optical variability and X-ray luminosity. As this correlation is found to be independent of accretion activity, we argue that X-ray production in PMS stars must instead be intimately connected with the presence and strength of optically variable, magnetically active surface regions (i.e., spots) on these stars. Moreover, because X-ray variability and optical variability are rarely time-correlated, we conclude that the sites of X-ray production are not exclusively cospatial with these regions. We argue that solar-analog coronae, heated by topologically complex fields, can explain these findings.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a synoptic study of the photometric and spectroscopic variability of the classical T Tauri star AA Tau on timescales ranging from a few hours to several weeks. The AA Tau light curve had been previously shown to vary with a 8.2 d period, exhibiting a roughly constant brightness level, interrupted by quasi-cyclic fading episodes, which we interpreted as recurrent eclipses of the central star by the warped inner edge of its accretion disk (Bouvier et al. \cite{Bouvier99}). Our observations show the system is dynamic and presents non-stationary variability both in the photometry and spectroscopy.  The star exhibits strong emission lines that show substantial variety and variability in their profile shapes and fluxes. Emission lines such as Halpha and Hbeta show both infall and outflow signatures and are well reproduced by magnetospheric accretion models with moderate mass accretion rates (10-8-10-9  {M}_sun yr-1) and high inclinations (i >=60degr ). The veiling shows variations that indicate the presence of 2 rotationally modulated hot spots corresponding to the two  magnetosphere poles. It correlates well with the He I line flux, with B-V and the V excess flux. We have indications of a time delay between the main emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta and He I) and veiling, the lines formed farther away preceding the veiling changes. The time delay we measure is consistent with accreted material propagating downwards the accretion columns at free fall velocity from a distance of about 8 R_star . In addition, we report periodic radial velocity variations of the photospheric spectrum which might point to the existence of a 0.02 \msun object orbiting the star at a distance of 0.08 AU.   During a few days, the eclipses disappeared, the variability of the system was strongly reduced and the line fluxes and veiling severely depressed. We argue that this episode of quiescence corresponds to the temporary disruption of the magnetic configuration at the disk inner edge. The smooth radial velocity variations of inflow and outflow diagnostics in the Halpha profile yield further evidence for large scale variations of the magnetic configuration on a timescale of a month. These results may provide the first clear evidence for large scale instabilities developping in T Tauri magnetospheres as the magnetic field lines are twisted by differential rotation between the star and the inner disk. The interaction between the inner accretion disk and the stellar magnetosphere thus appears to be a highly dynamical and time dependent process.

	Abstract = {We have simultaneously monitored the photometric and polarimetric variations of the Classical T Tauri star AA Tau during the fall of 2002. We combine these data with previously published polarimetric data covering two earlier epochs. The phase coverage is complete, although not contiguous. AA Tau clearly shows cyclic variations coupled with the rotation of the system. The star-disk system produces a repeatable polarisation curve where the polarisation increases with decreasing brightness. The data fit well with the model put forward by Bouvier et al. (1999) where AA Tau is viewed almost edge-on and its disk is actively dumping material onto the central star via magnetospheric accretion. The inner edge of the disk is deformed by its interaction with the tilted magnetosphere, producing ``eclipses'' as it rotates and occults the photosphere periodically. From the shape of the polarisation curve in the QU-plane we confirm that the accretion disk is seen at a large inclination, almost edge-on, and predict that its position angle is PA  ~ 90o, i.e., that the disk's major axis is oriented in the East-West direction.

@article{gro07,
	Abstract = {Context: Classical T Tauri stars are young solar-type stars accreting material from their circumstellar disks. Thanks to a favorable inclination of the system, the classical T Tauri star AA Tau exhibits periodic optical eclipses as the warped inner disk edge occults the stellar photosphere.  Aims: We intend to observe the X-ray and UV emission of AA Tau during the optical eclipses with the aim of localizing these emitting regions on the star.  Methods: AA Tau was observed for about 5 h per XMM-Newton orbit (2 days) over 8 successive orbits, which covers two optical eclipse periods (8.22 days). The XMM-Newton optical/UV monitor simultaneously provided UV photometry (UVW2 filter at 206 nm) with a ~15 min sampling rate. Some V-band photometry was also obtained from the ground during this period in order to determine the dates of the eclipses.  Results: Two X-ray and UV measurements were secured close to the center of the eclipse (Delta V~1.5 mag). The UV flux is the highest just before the eclipse starts and the lowest towards the end of it. UV flux variations amount to a few 0.1 mag on a timescale of a few hours and up to 1 mag on a timescale of a week, none of which are correlated with the X-ray flux. We model it with a weekly modulation (inner disk eclipse), plus a daily modulation, which suggests a non-steady accretion, but needs a longer observation to be confirmed. No such eclipses are detected in X-rays. Within each 5 h-long observation, AA Tau has a nearly constant X-ray count rate. On a timescale of days to weeks, the X-ray flux varies by a factor of 2-8, except for one measurement where the X-ray count rate was nearly 50 times higher than the minimum observed level even though photoelectric absorption was the highest at this phase, and the plasma temperature reached 60 MK, i.e. a factor of 2-3 higher than in the other observations. This X-ray event, observed close to the center of the optical eclipse, is interpreted as an X-ray flare.  Conclusions: We explain the variable column density with the low-density accretion funnel flows blanketing the magnetosphere. The lack of X-ray eclipses indicates that X-ray emitting regions are located at high latitudes. Furthermore, the occurrence of a strong X-ray flare near the center of the optical eclipse suggests that the magnetically active areas are closely associated with the base of the high-density accretion funnel flow. We speculate that the impact of this free-falling accretion flow onto the strong magnetic field of the stellar corona may boost the X-ray emission.},

	Abstract = {Na I D lines in the spectrum of the young binary KH 15D have been analyzed in detail. We find an excess absorption component that may be attributed to foreground interstellar absorption, and to gas possibly associated with the solids in the circumbinary disk. The derived column density is log N_Na\,\mathsc{i} = 12.5 cm-2, centered on a radial velocity that is consistent with the systemic velocity. Subtracting the likely contribution of the interstellar medium leaves log N_Na\,\mathsc{i} \sim 12.3 cm-2. There is no detectable change in the gas column density across the "knife edge" formed by the opaque grain disk, indicating that the gas and solids have very different scale heights, with the solids being highly settled. Our data support a picture of this circumbinary disk as being composed of a very thin particulate grain layer composed of millimeter-sized or larger objects that are settled within whatever remaining gas may be present. This phase of disk evolution has been hypothesized to exist as a prelude to the formation of planetesimals through gravitational fragmentation, and is expected to be short-lived if much gas were still present in such a disk. Our analysis also reveals the presence of excess Na I emission relative to the comparison spectrum at the radial velocity of the currently visible star that plausibly arises within the magnetosphere of this still-accreting young star.},

	Abstract = {This is a draft chapter for a book, entitled Physical Processes in Circumstellar Disks around Young Stars, which is scheduled for publication by the University of Chicago Press as one of its Theoretical Astrophysics Series volumes. Sect. 1 presents the motivation for considering the effects of a large-scale, ordered magnetic field on the formation and evolution of protostellar disks. Sect. 2 outlines the physical principles that underlie the magnetohydrodynamics of disks that are threaded by such a field. Sect. 3 discusses the formation and early evolution of disks that result from the collapse of a rotating molecular cloud core that is coupled to the insterstellar magnetic field. Sect. 4 reviews the observational evidence for the disk--wind connection and describes the structure of magnetically accelerated disk outflows, focusing on centrifugally driven winds; it then goes on to discuss the equilibrium and stability properties of weakly ionized protostellar accretion disks in which the transport of angular momentum is dominated by a wind of this type. Sect. 5 considers the coupling between the central protostar and the surrounding disk through the protostellar magnetic field, covering, in turn, the phenomenology, basic concepts, and results of numerical simulations. The chapter is summarized in Sect. 6, which also contains a discussion of future research directions.},

	Abstract = {We have produced brightness and magnetic field maps of the surfaces of CVCha and CRCha: two actively accreting G- and K-type TTauri stars in the ChamaeleonI star-forming cloud with ages of 3-5Myr. Our magnetic field maps show evidence for strong, complex multipolar fields similar to those obtained for young rapidly rotating main-sequence stars. Brightness maps indicate the presence of dark polar caps and low-latitude spots - these brightness maps are very similar to those obtained for other pre-main-sequence and rapidly rotating main-sequence stars.  Only two other classical TTauri stars have been studied using similar techniques so far: V2129Oph and BPTau. CVCha and CRCha show magnetic field patterns that are significantly more complex than those recovered for BPTau, a fully convective TTauri star.  We discuss possible reasons for this difference and suggest that the complexity of the stellar magnetic field is related to the convection zone; with more complex fields being found in TTauri stars with radiative cores (V2129Oph, CVCha and CRCha). However, it is clearly necessary to conduct magnetic field studies of TTauri star systems, exploring a wide range of stellar parameters in order to establish how they affect magnetic field generation, and thus how these magnetic fields are likely to affect the evolution of TTauri star systems as they approach the main sequence.},

	Abstract = {Context: In classical T Tauri stars, X-rays are produced by two plasma components: a hot low-density plasma, with frequent flaring activity, and a high-density lower temperature plasma. The former is coronal plasma related to the stellar magnetic activity. The latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars, could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. However its nature is still being debated.  Aims: Our aim is to probe the soft X-ray emission from the high-density plasma component in classical T Tauri stars to check whether this plasma is heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronal plasma.  Methods: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy allows us to measure individual line fluxes. We analyze X-ray spectra of the classical T Tauri stars MP Muscae and TW Hydrae. Our aim is to evaluate line ratios to search for optical depth effects, which are expected in the accretion-driven scenario. We also derive the plasma emission measure distributions EMD, to investigate whether and how the EMD of accreting and non accreting young stars differ. The results are compared to those obtained for the non-accreting weak-line T Tauri star TWA 5.  Results: We find evidence of resonance scattering in the strongest lines of MP Mus, supporting the idea that soft X-rays are produced by plasma heated in the accretion shock. We also find that the EMD of MP Mus has two peaks: a cool peak at temperatures expected for plasma heated in the accretion shock, and a hot peak typical of coronal plasma. The shape of the EMD of MP Mus appears to be the superposition of the EMD of a pure coronal source, like TWA 5, and an EMD alike that of TW Hya, which is instead dominated by shock-heated plasma.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study the properties of X-ray emitting plasma of MP Mus, an old classical T Tauri star. We check whether an accretion process could produce the observed X-ray emission and we derive the accretion parameters and the characteristics of the shock-heated plasma. We compare the properties of MP Mus with those of younger classical T Tauri stars to test whether age is related to the properties of the X-ray emitting plasma. Methods: XMM-Newton X-ray spectra allow us to measure plasma temperatures, abundances, and electron density. The density of cool plasma probes whether X-ray emission is produced by plasma heated in the accretion process.  Results: X-ray emission from MP Mus originates from high density cool plasma but a hot flaring component is also present, suggesting that both coronal magnetic activity and accretion contribute to the observed X-ray emission. We find a Ne/O ratio similar to that observed in the much younger classical T Tauri star BP Tau. From the soft part of the X-ray emission, mostly produced by plasma heated in the accretion shock, we derive a mass accretion rate of 5×10-11 M_o yr-1.},

	Abstract = {We have performed mid-IR photometry of the young open cluster NGC 2264 using the images obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer instruments and presented a normalized classification scheme of young stellar objects in various color-color diagrams to make full use of the information from multicolor photometry. These results are compared with the classification scheme based on the slope of the spectral energy distribution (SED). From the spatial distributions of Class I and II stars, we have identified two subclusterings of Class I objects in the CONE region of Sung et al. The disked stars in the other star-forming region S Mon are mostly Class II objects. These three regions show a distinct difference in the fractional distribution of SED slopes as well as the mean value of SED slopes. The fraction of stars with primordial disks is nearly flat between log m = 0.2 and -0.5 and that of transition disks is very high for solar mass stars. In addition, we have derived a somewhat higher value of the primordial disk fraction for NGC 2264 members located below the main pre-main-sequence locus (so-called BMS stars). This result supports the idea that BMS stars are young stars with nearly edge-on disks. We have also found that the fraction of primordial disks is very low near the most massive star S Mon and increases with distance from S Mon.},

	Abstract = {We have performed deep wide-field CCD photometry of the young open cluster NGC 2264 to study the extent of star-forming regions (SFRs) and the shape of the initial mass function. In this paper, we present VRI and Halpha photometry for more than 67,000 stars. From the spatial distribution of the selected Halpha emission stars, we identify two active SFRs and a less active halo region surrounding these two SFRs. There are several Halpha emission stars in the field region outside the halo region, and these may be newly formed stars in the Mon OB1 association surrounding the cluster. The locus of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the IC versus V - IC diagram is revised from the distribution of Halpha and X-ray emission stars in the diagram. The mean reddening of late-type PMS stars is estimated to be E(B - V) ≈ 0.2 mag using the distribution of X-ray emission stars in the 2MASS color-color diagram. We can confirm that the Halpha emission stars below the PMS locus (so-called BMS stars) are bona-fide members of NGC 2264 from their spatial distribution as well as from their near-IR excess in the 2MASS color-color diagram. In addition, four objects around IRS-2 detected with the Spitzer IRAC are also classified as BMS stars.  Based on observations made with the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), the 1 m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), and data from the 2MASS project (University of Massachusetts and IPAC/Caltech, USA).},

	Abstract = {From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS and NARVAL spectropolarimeters, we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on the classical T Tauri star (cTTS) BP Tau. Circular polarization signatures in photospheric lines and in narrow emission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout most of the rotation cycle of BP Tau at two different epochs in 2006. We observe that rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of both unpolarized and circularly polarized spectral proxies tracing the photosphere and the footpoints of accretion funnels.  From the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of BP Tau using tomographic imaging. We find that the field of BP Tau involves a 1.2 kG dipole and 1.6 kG octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation axis. Accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at high latitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2 per cent of the stellar surface. The strong mainly axisymmetric poloidal field of BP Tau is very reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully convective dwarfs. It suggests that magnetic fields of fully convective cTTSs such as BP Tau are likely not fossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating within the bulk of their convective zones.  Preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of BP Tau extends to distances of at least 4R* to ensure that accretion spots are located at high latitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellar wind. It apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as the corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of BP Tau.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on the low-mass classical T Tauri star (cTTS) V2247 Oph. Profile distortions and circular polarization signatures detected in photospheric lines can be interpreted as caused by cool spots and magnetic regions at the surface of the star. The large-scale field is of moderate strength and highly complex; moreover, both the spot distribution and the magnetic field show significant variability on a time-scale of only 1 week, as a likely result of strong differential rotation. Both properties make V2247 Oph very different from the (more massive) prototypical cTTS BP Tau; we speculate that this difference reflects the lower mass of V2247 Oph.  During our observations, V2247 Oph was in a low-accretion state, with emission lines showing only weak levels of circular polarization; we nevertheless find that excess emission apparently concentrates in a mid-latitude region of a strong radial field, suggesting that it is the footpoint of an accretion funnel.  The weaker and more complex field that we report on V2247 Oph may share similarities with those of very-low-mass late-M dwarfs and potentially explain why low-mass cTTSs rotate on average faster than intermediate-mass ones. These surprising results need confirmation from new independent data sets on V2247 Oph and other similar low-mass cTTSs.

	Abstract = {Magnetic fields are present in a wide variety of stars throughout the HR diagram and play a role at basically all evolutionary stages, from very-low-mass dwarfs to very massive stars, and from young star-forming molecular clouds and protostellar accretion discs to evolved giants/supergiants and magnetic white dwarfs/neutron stars. These fields range from a few muG (e.g., in molecular clouds) to TG and more (e.g., in magnetic neutron stars); in nondegenerate stars in particular, they feature large-scale topologies varying from simple nearly axisymmetric dipoles to complex nonaxsymmetric structures, and from mainly poloidal to mainly toroidal topologies. After recalling the main techniques of detecting and modeling stellar magnetic fields, we review the existing properties of magnetic fields reported in cool, hot, and young nondegenerate stars and protostars, and discuss our understanding of the origin of these fields and their impact on the birth and life of stars.},

	Abstract = {The lifetime of isolated protoplanetary disks is thought to be set by the combination of viscous accretion and photoevaporation driven by stellar high-energy photons. Observational evidence for magnetospheric accretion in young Sun-like stars is robust. Here we report the first observational evidence for disk photoevaporation driven by the central star. We acquired high-resolution (R~ 30,000) spectra of the [Ne II] 12.81 mum line from seven circumstellar disks using VISIR on Melipal/VLT. We show that the three transition disks in the sample all have [Ne II] line profiles consistent with those predicted by a photoevaporative flow driven by stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photons. The ~6 km s-1 blueshift of the line from the almost face-on disk of TW Hya is clearly inconsistent with emission from a static disk atmosphere and convincingly points to the presence of a photoevaporative wind. We do not detect any [Ne II] line close to the stellar velocity from the sample of classical optically thick (nontransition) disks. We conclude that most of the spectrally unresolved [Ne II] emission in these less-evolved systems arises from jets/outflows rather than from the disk. The pattern of the [Ne II] detections and nondetections suggests that EUV-driven photoevaporation starts only at a later stage in the disk evolution.  Based on observations made with VISIR on the UT3/Melipal ESO Telescope at Paranal under programme ID 080.C-0404(A).},

	Abstract = {X-ray emitting features originating from the interaction of supernova shock waves with small interstellar gas clouds are revealed in many X-ray observations of evolved supernova remnants (e.g. Cygnus Loop and Vela), but their interpretation is not straightforward. We develop a self-consistent method for the analysis and interpretation of shock-cloud interactions in middle-aged supernova remnants, which can provide the key parameters of the system and the role of relevant physical effects like the thermal conduction, without the need to run ad-hoc numerical simulations and to bother of morphology details. We explore all the possible values of the shock speed and cloud density contrast relevant to middle-aged SNRs with a set of hydrodynamic simulations of shock-cloud interaction, including the effects of thermal conduction and radiative cooling. From the simulations, we synthesize spatially and spectrally resolved focal-plane data as they would be collected with XMM-Newton/EPIC, an X-ray instrument commonly used in these studies. We devise and tune up two diagnostic tools, the first based on the mean-photon energy vs. count rate scatter plot and the second on the spectral analysis of the interaction region, that can be used to highlight the effects of thermal conduction and to derive the shock speed in case of efficient conduction at work. These tools can be used to ascertain information from X-ray observations, without the need to develop detailed and ad-hoc numerical models for the interpretation of the data.},

	Abstract = {Context: Recent developments in the study of mixed morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) have revealed the presence of metal-rich X-ray emitting plasma inside a fraction of these remnants, a feature not properly addressed by traditional models for these objects.  Aims: Radial profiles of thermodynamical and chemical parameters are needed for a fruitful comparison of data and model of MMSNRs, but these are available only in a few cases.  Methods: We analyzed XMM-Newton data of two MMSNRs, namely IC 443 and G166.0+4.3, previously known to have solar metal abundances, and performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray emission.  Results: We detected enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg and Si in the hard X-ray bright peak in the north of IC 443, and of sulphur in the outer regions of G166.0+4.3. The metal abundances are not distributed uniformly in both remnants. The evaporating clouds model and the radiative SNR model fail to reproduce consistently all the observational results.  Conclusions: We suggest that further deep X-ray observations of MMSNRs may reveal more metal-rich objects. More detailed models including ISM-ejecta mixing are needed to explain the nature of this growing subclass of MMSNRs.},

	Abstract = {From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, we report the discovery of magnetic fields at the surface of the mildly accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) V2129 Oph. Zeeman signatures are detected, both in photospheric lines and in the emission lines formed at the base of the accretion funnels linking the disc to the protostar, and monitored over the whole rotation cycle of V2129 Oph. We observe that rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of both unpolarized and circularly polarized line profiles.  We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology at the surface of V2129 Oph from both sets of Zeeman signatures simultaneously. We find it to be rather complex, with a dominant octupolar component and a weak dipole of strengths 1.2 and 0.35 kG, respectively, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation axis. The large-scale field is anchored in a pair of 2-kG unipolar radial field spots located at high latitudes and coinciding with cool dark polar spots at photospheric level. This large-scale field geometry is unusually complex compared to those of non-accreting cool active subgiants with moderate rotation rates.  As an illustration, we provide a first attempt at modelling the magnetospheric topology and accretion funnels of V2129 Oph using field extrapolation. We find that the magnetosphere of V2129 Oph must extend to about 7R* to ensure that the footpoints of accretion funnels coincide with the high-latitude accretion spots on the stellar surface. It suggests that the stellar magnetic field succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as the corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of V2129 Oph. The magnetospheric geometry we derive qualitatively reproduces the modulation of Balmer lines and produces X-ray coronal fluxes typical of those observed in cTTSs.  Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {Models of magnetospheric accretion on to classical T Tauri stars often assume that stellar magnetic fields are simple dipoles. Recently published surface magnetograms of BP Tau and V2129 Oph have shown, however, that their fields are more complex. The magnetic field of V2129 Oph was found to be predominantly octupolar. For BP Tau, the magnetic energy was shared mainly between the dipole and octupole field components, with the dipole component being almost four times as strong as that of V2129 Oph. From the published surface maps of the photospheric magnetic fields, we extrapolate the coronal fields of both stars, and compare the resulting field structures with that of a dipole. We consider different models where the disc is truncated at, or well within, the Keplerian corotation radius. We find that although the structure of the surface magnetic field is particularly complex for both stars, the geometry of the larger scale field, along which accretion is occurring, is somewhat simpler. However, the larger scale field is distorted close to the star by the stronger field regions, with the net effect being that the fractional open flux through the stellar surface is less than would be expected with a dipole magnetic field model. Finally, we estimate the disc truncation radius, assuming that this occurs where the magnetic torque from the stellar magnetosphere is comparable to the viscous torque in the disc.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a comparative study of XMM-Newton observations of four classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), namely BP Tau, CR Cha, SU Aur and TW Hya. In these objects coronal, i.e. magnetic, activity and as recently shown, magnetically funneled accretion are the processes likely to be responsible for the generation of X-ray emission. Variable X-ray emission with luminosities in the order of 1030 erg/s is observed for all targets. We investigate light curves as well as medium and high-resolution X-ray spectra to determine the plasma properties of the sample CTTS and to study the origin of their X-ray emission and its variability. The emission measure distributions and observed temperatures differ significantly and the targets are dominated either by plasma at high densities as produced by accretion shocks or by predominantly hotter plasma of coronal origin. Likewise the variability of the X-ray luminosity is found to be generated by both mechanisms. Cool plasma at high densities is found in all stars with detected O VII triplet emission, prevented only for SU Aur due to strong absorption. A general trend is present in the abundance pattern, with neon being at solar value or enhanced while oxygen, iron and most other metals are depleted, pointing to the presence of the inverse FIP effect in active coronae and possibly grain formation in evolved disks. We find that both accretion shocks and coronal activity contribute to the observed X-ray emission of the targets. While coronal activity is the dominant source of X-ray activity in the majority of the CTTS, the fraction for each process differs significantly between the individual objects.},

	Abstract = {We present Chandra HETGS observations of the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) V4046 Sgr. The He-like triplets of O VII, Ni IX, and Si XIII are clearly detected. Similar to the CTTS TW Hya and BP Tau, the forbidden lines of O VII and Ne IX are weak compared to the intercombination line, indicating high plasma densities in the X-ray emitting regions. The Si XIII triplet, however, is within the low-density limit, in agreement with the predictions of the accretion funnel infall model with an additional stellar corona. V4046 Sgr is the first close binary exhibiting these features. Together with previous high-resolution X-ray data on TW Hya and BP Tau, and in contrast to T Tau, now three out of four CTTS show evidence of accretion funnels.},

	Abstract = {Context: X-ray flares are common phenomena in pre-main sequence stars. Their analysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. The Orion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of young low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP), an ~10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).   Aims: Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 Mo) ONC members in order to test and constrain the physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods: We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares.  Results: The high energy tail of the energy distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index ~2.2. We test the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2 Mo), we establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray luminosity have very similar flare frequencies.  Conclusions: Our observational results are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are entirely built by overlapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution; the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and form a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.},

	Abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 13.6 eV <hnu lsim 100 eV) and X-rays in the 0.1-2 keV band can heat the surfaces of disks around young, low-mass stars to thousands of degrees and ionize species with ionization potentials greater than 13.6 eV. Shocks generated by protostellar winds can also heat and ionize the same species close to the star/disk system. These processes produce diagnostic lines (e.g., [Ne II] 12.8 mum and [O I] 6300 {\AA}) that we model as functions of key parameters such as EUV luminosity and spectral shape, X-ray luminosity and spectral shape, and wind mass loss rate and shock speed. Comparing our models with observations, we conclude that either internal shocks in the winds or X-rays incident on the disk surfaces often produce the observed [Ne II] line, although there are cases where EUV may dominate. Shocks created by the oblique interaction of winds with disks are unlikely [Ne II] sources because these shocks are too weak to ionize Ne. Even if [Ne II] is mainly produced by X-rays or internal wind shocks, the neon observations typically place upper limits of lsim1042 s-1 on the EUV photon luminosity of these young low-mass stars. The observed [O I] 6300 {\AA} line has both a low velocity component (LVC) and a high velocity component. The latter likely arises in internal wind shocks. For the former we find that X-rays likely produce more [O I] luminosity than either the EUV layer, the transition layer between the EUV and X-ray layer, or the shear layer where the protostellar wind shocks and entrains disk material in a radial flow across the surface of the disk. Our soft X-ray models produce [O I] LVCs with luminosities up to 10-4 L sun, but may not be able to explain the most luminous LVCs.},

	Abstract = {The nature of the magnetic coupling between T Tauri stars and their discs determines not only the mass accretion process but possibly the spin evolution of the central star. We have taken a recently published surface magnetogram of one moderately accreting T Tauri star (V2129 Oph) and used it to extrapolate the geometry of its large-scale field. We determine the structure of the open (wind-bearing) field lines, the closed (X-ray bright) field lines and the relatively small subset of field lines that pass through the equatorial plane inside the Keplerian corotation radius and which are therefore available to accrete.  We consider a series of models in which the stellar magnetic field is opened up by the outward pressure of the hot coronal gas at a range of radii or source surfaces. As the source surface is increased, accretion takes place along progressively simpler field structures and impacts on progressively fewer sites at the stellar surface. This is consistent with the observed variation in the CaII IRT and HeI lines which suggests that accretion in the visible hemisphere is confined to a single high-latitude spot. By determining the density and velocity of the accretion flows, we find that in order to have most of the total mass accretion rate impacting on a single high-latitude region we need disc material to accrete from approximately 7Rsolar, close to the Keplerian corotation radius at 6.8Rsolar.  We also calculate the coronal density and X-ray emission measure. We find that both the magnitude and rotational modulation of the emission measure increase as the source surface is increased. For the field structure of V2129 Oph which is dominantly octupolar, the emission forms a bright, high-latitude ring that is always in view as the star rotates. Since the accretion funnels are not dense enough to cause significant scattering of coronal X-ray photons, they provide only a low rotational modulation of around 10 per cent at most.

	Abstract = {We study the properties of powerful X-ray flares from 161 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in the Orion Nebula region. Relationships between flare properties, protoplanetary disks, and accretion are examined in detail to test models of star-disk interactions at the inner edge of the accretion disks. Previous studies found no differences in flaring between disk-free and accreting systems other than a small overall diminution of X-ray luminosity in accreting systems. The most important finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating disk-free stars can significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop sizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This is consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction in which the inner disk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere. We also find two differences between flares in accreting and disk-free PMS stars. First, a subclass of superhot flares with peak plasma temperatures exceeding 100 MK are preferentially present in accreting systems. Second, we tentatively find that accreting stars produce flares with shorter durations. Both results may be consequences of the distortion and destabilization of the stellar magnetosphere by the interacting disk. Finally, we find no evidence that any flare types, even slow-rise top-flat flares, are produced in star-disk magnetic loops. All are consistent with enhanced solar long-duration events with both footpoints anchored in the stellar surface.},

	Abstract = {Pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars are known to produce powerful X-ray flares, which resemble magnetic reconnection solar flares scaled by factors up to 104. However, there are numerous puzzles, including the structure of X-ray-emitting coronae and magnetospheres, the effects of protoplanetary disks, and the effects of stellar rotation. To investigate these issues in detail, we examine 216 of the brightest flares from 161 PMS stars observed in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP). These constitute the largest homogeneous data set of PMS, or indeed stellar flares at any stellar age, ever acquired. Our effort is based on a new flare spectral analysis technique that avoids nonlinear parametric modeling. We provide a catalog of derived properties and an electronic atlas for this unique collection of flares. The current study (Paper I) examines the flare morphologies, and provides a general comparison of COUP flare characteristics with those of other active X-ray stars and the Sun. Paper II will concentrate on relationships between flare behavior, protoplanetary disks, and other stellar properties. Several results are obtained. First, COUP flares are among the most powerful, longest, and hottest, corresponding to the largest known coronal structures. Second, no significant statistical differences in peak flare luminosity or temperature distributions are found among different morphological flare classes, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for all flares. Third, comparison with the general solar scaling laws indicates that COUP flares may not adequately fit proposed power-temperature and duration-temperature solar-stellar fits. Fourth, COUP superhot flares are found to be brighter but shorter than cooler COUP flares. Finally, the majority of bright COUP flares can be viewed as enhanced analogs of the rare solar ``long-duration events.''},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the geometric and physical parameters of 281 EUV nanoflares, simultaneously detected with the TRACE telescope in the 171 and 195 {\AA} wavelengths. The detection and discrimination of these flarelike events is detailed in the first paper in this series. We determine the loop length l, loop width w, emission measure EM, the evolution of the electron density ne(t) and temperature Te(t), the flare decay time taudecay, and calculate the radiative loss time tauloss, the conductive loss time taucond, and the thermal energy Eth. The findings are as follows: (1) EUV nanoflares in the energy range of 1024-1026 ergs represent miniature versions of larger flares observed in soft X-rays (SXR) and hard X-rays (HXR), scaled to lower temperatures (Te<~2 MK), lower densities (ne<~109 cm-3), and somewhat smaller spatial scales (l~2-20 Mm). (2) The cooling time taudecay is compatible with the radiative cooling time taurad, but the conductive cooling timescale taucond is about an order of magnitude shorter, suggesting repetitive heating cycles in time intervals of a few minutes. (3) The frequency distribution of thermal energies of EUV nanoflares, N(E)~10-46(E/1024)-1.8 (s-1 cm-2 ergs-1) matches that of SXR microflares in the energy range of 1026-1029, and exceeds that of nonthermal energies of larger flares observed in HXR by a factor of 3-10 (in the energy range of 1029-1032 ergs). Discrepancies of the power-law slope with other studies, which report higher values in the range of a=2.0-2.6 (Krucker & Benz; Parnell & Jupp), are attributed to methodical differences in the detection and discrimination of EUV microflares, as well as to different model assumptions in the calculation of the electron density. Besides the insufficient power of nanoflares to heat the corona, we find also other physical limits for nanoflares at energies <~1024 ergs, such as the area coverage limit, the heating temperature limit, the lower coronal density limit, and the chromospheric loop height limit. Based on these quantitative physical limitations, it appears that coronal heating requires other energy carriers that are not luminous in EUV, SXR, and HXR.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study an anomaly in the X-ray flux (or luminosity) ratio between the O vii lambdalambda21.6-22.1 triplet and the O viii Lyalpha line seen in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS). This ratio is unusually high when compared with ratios for main-sequence and non-accreting T Tauri stars (Telleschi et al. 2007c, A&A, 468, 443). We compare these samples to identify the source of the excess. A sample of recently discovered X-ray stars with a soft component attributed to jet emission is also considered.  Methods: We discuss data obtained from the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST) project, complemented by data from the published literature. We also present data from the CTTS RU Lup.  Results: All CTTS in the sample show an anomalous O vii/O viii flux ratio when compared with WTTS or MS stars. The anomaly is due to an excess of cool, O vii emitting material rather than a deficiency of hotter plasma. The excess plasma must therefore have temperatures of ⪅2 MK. This soft excess does not correlate with UV excesses of CTTS, but seems to be related to the stellar X-ray luminosity. The spectra of the jet-driving TTS do not fit into this context.  Conclusions: The soft excess depends both on the presence of accretion streams in CTTS and on magnetic activity. The gas may be shock-heated near the surface, although it may also be heated in the magnetospheric accretion funnels. The soft component of the jet-driving sources is unlikely to be due to the same process.},

	Abstract = {Context: Low-mass stars are known to exhibit strong X-ray emission during their early evolutionary stages. This also applies to classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), whose X-ray emission differs from that of main-sequence stars in a number of aspects.  Aims: We study the specific case of RU Lup, a well known accreting and wind-driving CTTS. In comparison with other bright CTTS we study possible signatures of accretion and winds in their X-ray emission.  Methods: Using three XMM-Newton observations of RU Lup, we investigate its X-ray properties and their generating mechanisms. High-resolution X-ray spectra of RU Lup and other CTTS are compared to main-sequence stars. We examine the presence of a cool plasma excess and enhanced plasma density in relation to X-rays from accretion shocks and investigate anomalous strong X-ray absorption and its connection to winds or circumstellar material. Results: We find three distinguishable levels of activity among the observations of RU Lup. While no large flares are present, this variability is clearly of magnetic origin due to the corresponding plasma temperatures of around 30 MK; in contrast the cool plasma component at 2-3 MK is quite stable over a month, resulting in a drop of average plasma temperature from 35 MK down to 10 MK. Density analysis with the O VII triplet indicates high densities in the cool plasma, suggesting accretion shocks to be a significant contributor to the soft X-ray emission. No strong overall metal depletion is observed, with Ne being more abundant than Fe, that is at solar value, and especially O. Excess emission at 6.4 keV during the more active phase suggest the presence of iron fluorescence. Additionally RU Lup exhibits an extraordinary strong X-ray absorption, incompatible with estimates obtained at optical and UV wavelengths. Comparing spectra from a sample of main-sequence stars with those of accreting stars we find an excess of cool plasma as evidenced by lower O VIII/O VII line ratios in all accreting stars. High density plasma appears to be only present in low-mass CTTS, while accreting stars with intermediate masses (≳2~Mo) have lower densities.  Conclusions: In all investigated CTTS the characteristics of the cooler X-ray emitting plasma are influenced by the accretion process. We suspect different accretion rates and amounts of funnelling, possibly linked to stellar mass and radius, to be mainly responsible for the different properties of their cool plasma component. The exceptional X-ray absorption in RU Lup and other CTTS is probably related to the accretion flows and an optically transparent wind emanating from the star or the disk.},

	Abstract = {Context: Accretion and ejection are complex and related processes that vary on various timescales in young stars.  Aims: We intend to investigate the accretion and outflow dynamics and their interaction from observations of the classical T Tauri star AA Tau.  Methods: From a long time series of high resolution (R=115 000) HARPS spectra and simultaneous broad-band photometry, we report new evidence for magnetospheric accretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri star AA Tau.  Results: AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22 d. The recurrent luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by the magnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 R_*. Balmer line profiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted absorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight. At the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag, indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by the magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The photospheric and He I radial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling is modulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of the accretion funnel. Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are also presented. Conclusions: .The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly edge-on) allows us to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. We find that most spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scale magnetosphere tilted by 20$\,^{\circ}$ onto the star's spin axis. We also find evidence for time variability of the magnetospheric accretion flow on a timescale of a few rotational periods.

	Abstract = {Accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be less luminous in X-rays than non-accretors, an effect that has been detected in various star-forming regions. To explain this we have combined, for the first time, a radiative transfer code with an accretion model that considers magnetic fields extrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface, with extended field lines interacting with the disc. We study the propagation of coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they are strongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns. The reduction in the observed X-ray emission depends on the field geometry, which may explain why accreting T Tauri stars show a larger scatter in their observed X-ray luminosity compared with non-accreting stars.},

	Abstract = {The origin and evolution of the X-ray emission in very young stellar objects (YSOs) are not yet well understood because it is very hard to observe YSOs in the protostellar phase. Using COUP data, we study the X-ray properties of stars in the ONC in different evolutionary classes: luminosities, hydrogen column densities NH, effective plasma temperatures, and time variability are compared to understand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and the central object can influence the X-ray emission. We have assembled the deepest and most complete photometric catalog of objects in the ONC region from the UV to 8 mum using data from the HST Treasury Program; deep and almost simultaneous UBVI and JHK images taken, respectively, with WFI at ESO 2.2 m and ISPI at CTIO 4 m telescopes; and Spitzer IRAC imaging. We select high-probability candidate Class 0-I protostars, a sample of ``bona fide'' Class II stars, and a set of Class III stars with IR emission consistent with normal photospheres. Our principal result is that Class 0-Ia objects are significantly less luminous in X-rays, in both the total and hard bands, than the more evolved Class II stars with mass larger than 0.5 Msolar the latter show X-ray luminosities similar to those of Class 0-Ib stars. This result supports the hypothesis that the onset of X-ray emission occurs at a very early stage of star formation. Spectral properties of Class 0-I stars are similar to those of the more evolved Class II and III objects, except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the envelope or disk of the protostellar objects. Our data suggest that the three different classes have similar X-ray temporal variability.},

	Abstract = {X-ray luminosities of accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be systematically lower than those of nonaccretors. There is as yet no widely accepted physical explanation for this effect, though it has been suggested that accretion somehow suppresses, disrupts or obscures coronal X-ray activity. Here, we suggest that the opposite might be the case: coronal X-rays modulate the accretion flow. We re-examine the X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster and find that not only are accreting stars systematically fainter, but that there is a correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar X-ray luminosity. We use the X-ray heated accretion disk models of Ercolano et al. to show that protoplanetary disk photoevaporative mass-loss rates are strongly dependent on stellar X-ray luminosity and sufficiently high to be competitive with accretion rates. X-ray disk heating appears to offer a viable mechanism for modulating the gas accretion flow and could be at least partially responsible for the observed correlation between accretion rates and X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {Context: The Taurus-Auriga star-forming complex hosts the only population of T Tauri stars in which an anticorrelation of X-ray activity and rotation period has been observed.   Aims: We aim to explain the origin of the X-ray activity-rotation relation in Taurus-Auriga. We also aim to put the X-ray activity of these stars into the context of the activity of late-type main-sequence stars and T Tauri stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster.  Methods: We have used XMM-Newton's European Photon Imaging Cameras to perform the most sensitive survey to date of X-ray emission (0.3-10 keV) from young stars in Taurus-Auriga. We investigated the dependences of X-ray activity measures - X-ray luminosity, L_X, its ratio with the stellar luminosity, L_X/Lstar, and the surface-averaged X-ray flux, F_XS - on rotation period and compared them with predictions based solely on the observed dependence of LX on a star's Lstar and whether it is accreting or not. We tested for differences in the distributions of L_X/Lstar of fast and slow rotators, accretors and non-accretors, and compared the dependence of L_X/Lstar on the ratio of the rotation period and the convective turnover timescale, the Rossby number, with that of late-type main-sequence stars.  Results: We found significant anticorrelations of LX and F_XS with rotation period, but these could be explained by the typically higher stellar luminosity and effective temperature of fast-rotators in Taurus-Auriga and a near-linear dependence of LX on Lstar. We found no evidence for a dependence of L_X/Lstar on rotation period, but for accretors to have lower L_X/Lstar than non-accretors at all rotation periods. The Rossby numbers of accretors and non-accretors were found to be the same as those of late-type main-sequence stars showing saturated X-ray emission.  Conclusions: Non-accreting T Tauri stars show X-ray activity entirely consistent with the saturated activity of fast-rotating late-type main-sequence stars. Accreting T Tauri stars show lower X-ray activity, but this cannot be attributed to their slower rotation.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a new study on the relationship between coronal X-ray emission and stellar rotation in late-type main-sequence stars. We have selected a sample of 259 dwarfs in the B-V range 0.5-2.0, including 110 field stars and 149 members of the Pleiades, Hyades, alpha Persei, IC 2602 and IC 2391 open clusters. All the stars have been observed with ROSAT, and most of them have photometrically-measured rotation periods available. Our results confirm that two emission regimes exist, one in which the rotation period is a good predictor of the total X-ray luminosity, and the other in which a constant saturated X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is attained; we present a quantitative estimate of the critical rotation periods below which stars of different masses (or spectral types) enter the saturated regime. In this work we have also empirically derived a characteristic time scale, taue , which we have used to investigate the relationship between the X-ray emission level and an X-ray-based Rossby number Re = Prot/taue: we show that our empirical time scale taue resembles the theoretical convective turnover time for 0.4 <~ M/Msun <~ 1.2, but it also has the same functional dependence on B-V as Lbol-1/2 in the color range 0.5 <~ B-V <~ 1.5. Our results imply that - for non-saturated coronae - the Lx - Prot relation is equivalent to the Lx/Lbol vs. Re relation.
